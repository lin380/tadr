Very unclear instructions not to mention ridiculous amounts of outdated readings required. Do yourself a favor and do not take any classes by her. You will regret it."

She gives pop quizzes but also gives at least 3 opportunities to replace a bad quiz grade if you come to class. Overall, she\'s helpful, to the point, and knows her stuff. Take this class for sure"

3350,0,5,"Amazing professor! One of the few professors that has left an everylasting impression. I learned so much in his class. He makes everything interesting! However, the class does require a lot of assignments but you\'ll do them and not care. He is just that awesome. You have labs where you need to prepare teaches (intimidating) but it\'s a wonderful exp"

4918,1,5,"This was one of the best courses I\'ve ever taken. He puts so much effort into his lectures and assignments, you really learn everything inside and out. You must put in the effort and follow his requirements in the syllabus to do well. Waiting until the last day to do the assignments is not a good idea. Not an easy A, but highly recommend."
2462,1,5,"I took PSYCH 337 Comm. & Society w/ Prof. Milburn (online). The material he provides is very interesting and I really enjoyed the class. He is extremely responsive if you ask him anything which is great. The class is very straight-forward and what is expected of you is laid out clearly. The work load is fair, & if you do the work you will do well."
982,1,1,"Would not recommend anyone to take his online course. According to Hassan, ""As far as I know, this course has never Audio or Vedio lectures because they are not developed by the departmentschool. So, we have to read the text book and then post any questions on any concept or methods here,and I will address it."" TA worked pretty hard."
4734,1,5,"Let me start by saying this is not an easy class. You will have tons of homework to do each week. That being said I think almost all Algebra classes have the same work. Mr. G is a good guy and wants people to pass. If you do the homework and study his review you will be fine. May not get an A, but you will pass. I would recommend him\xe2\x80\xa6"
7903,1,1,"Never actually explains what he wants. He will fail your assignments and not give clear feedback as to what he actually expects from you. Quiz, 2 journals, and groupwork due each week. Rude and extremely unhelpful."
