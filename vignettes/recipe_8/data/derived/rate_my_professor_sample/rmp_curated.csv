2360,0,5,Good guy and some funny jokes during his lectures. Took him for G208 and it was an easy A.
6828,0,5,Great proffessor and treats all students the same
9443,0,5,"He was really nice in general. Yes, he did wear the same short shorts over and over again but he has a wife and kids so he isn\'t that fruity. Get to know him he is very nice. He let me take the final two weeks late when I had the flu."
4353,0,5,"I like her, she forgave me and accepted that a piece of scratch paper really could just be a joke."
9584,1,5,Great professor! Be prepared to do the work but the work is easy if you apply yourself. Deadlines matter but he gives enough time to complete it. Assignments are based on current events so it easily keeps interest!
7460,1,5,"I have taken several online classes-1 of the most fantastic classes I have taken! I\'m CD major but we learned so much in such short time. The lectures & videos were great. Shout out to Prof Benavides! for being so organized, contacting us 2 see how we are doing, caring about us & motivating & pushing us. we learned about ourselves, family & life!!"
4320,1,5,"Easy. If you do the work, you\'ll pass."
2802,1,1,"I took professor Hardyway\'s general psych class online for a filler class. Worst professor I\'ve had in 3 years. Takes a long time to respond and very tough grader with no response for help. Wouldn\'t take his class again, not online at least."
43,1,1,Missed the first assignment because I was moving. Did every assignment thereafter and he had me dropped at midterms for not attending. Does not give clear instructions and he doesn\'t seem to care at all about the students. I get the impression he is one of those people that is miserable and wants everyone else to be miserable as well.
