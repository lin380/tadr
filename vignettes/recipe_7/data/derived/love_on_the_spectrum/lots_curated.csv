Love On The Spectrum,01,01,"It'll be like a fairy tale. A natural high, I suppose? Gets your heart racing. Can make people do crazy things. You just feel very warm inside yourself as a person. No. No. No. That was too awkward. Some girls don't feel like dating with someone with disabilities. Beep, beep, bi, boop. An A-plus partner looks like me. Oh! Would you like to get married? Um... ""The course of true love never did run smooth."" Of course it doesn't. Yes, ready.  Hello. My name is Michael, and I happen to be a 25-year-old man. about being on the spectrum? Well, autism is just a neurological disability. People with Asperger's or autism, they just learn things a different way. As far as I'm concerned, if anything, it's actually more of a gift. Michael? Oh, yes, I am. I would like to start dating. I just, um... don't really know how to get started, because... I've tried numerous ways, and they've all been unsuccessful. To become a husband. can be difficult. This room here is my bedroom, but I actually call it my quarters. It's the main place in this world that I feel safe. These are my love ducks. If you are single and seeking love, sit them beside your bed and love is sure to come your way. I actually bought them from a store in Newtown six years ago. Excuse me a second, gentlemen.  It's a plaque. I actually made it specifically for my future wife.  Five years ago. Oh, yes, I do. It's most important thing that I want to achieve. achieve that.  I really hope so, too. I seriously do. his first dating experience I often compare myself to Adam, my brother, a lot, which is a big mistake. I would often label him as a fresh cut of meat from God, and myself as a double scoop of dog shit. Why on earth he wanted to compare himself to me, I don't know, but... It's because I've often felt inferior to my brother. Adam was able to get himself in a relationship easily, whereas I had trouble doing so. The challenges that you face, Mike, I think a lot of other people face, too. To struggle at some point or another to find, like, proper love. But for some strange reason, I don't seem to recall Adam having any problems like that. But Michael, you've seen over the past few years, how it just hasn't worked out for me either. Like, it just turns to shit. That's also because a lot of people our age aren't interested in commitment. They're only interested in intercourse. Yeah. Look, it's true. Dad, did you drop your food? And also... I've also... What I've also noticed with a lot of girls your age, Liv, when they're still in high school, they only want a boyfriend for... Intercourse. Not just... Not just for intercourse, but also as a bodyguard and as a sugar daddy. I think every family needs a Michael. It just adds something different. Hi, I'm Chloe. I'm 19, and I'm autistic. I was born, well, not completely deaf, but never been able to hear fully. I have hearing aids, it's nothing to be ashamed of. N...  Not romantic love. I don't know what it's like to fall in love or have a crush. Yes, I have. I once dated a guy who, when I told him that I was autistic, he left me, because he didn't want to be associated with someone who's autistic. Well, I was a bit... angry, or I was confused. I was like, is autism really bad? Yes, I do. Took me a while, but I do, yes. When I tell someone I'm autistic, people go, ""Really? No, you're not. You don't look autistic."" And I can say, ""What does an autistic person look like?"" less likely than boys to be diagnosed. as we learn more I want to experience love. I want to be like everyone else, you know? I just don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. I see so many people holding hands and kissing and doing all that, and that's something I want. I had, like, all these ideas in my head, and none of them happened. Life is not a movie. What's up, man? Come here. the whole dating thing, that fairy-tale thing, it's gonna take a while to get to that. Yeah, I know. So, you know, don't expect that as the first one, because it's not an easy situation to get into. I'd like someone who I can talk to about Marvel, or, you know... Exactly. ...new cartoons and animes coming out. So, I'll go and crack on and start doing some dinner stuff. Remember, not touching. It won't be touching, Chloe. It won't be touching, I promise. I'm very picky when it comes... I don't like things touching other things. The beans have to be separated. Like, a little bit of beans on the side, they can't touch. All right, let them start warming. She's a really intelligent girl. She's, you know, incredibly intelligent, but socially, she's not. She's often had a lot of problems with difficulties reading someone's emotions. It's a lot harder to make a friendship. So, to move onto anything intimate, I think it would be a huge challenge. From the little girl that couldn't say any words to me, to the day she said ""daddy"" for the first time, to where she is now, yeah, I'm hugely proud of where she's come from. She's... She's done fantastically. She's, um... yeah. After everything she's had against her. Yep, sorry.  Yeah, no, she's done really well. I used to get bullied quite a lot in school in England for how I look. I got called names, I got pushed, I had, you know, my work ripped up, and called me deaf, and then I got called ""skeleton."" I think, you know, being bullied has made me who I am, and if I wasn't bullied, I would've been someone completely different. several times a week. Do you want milkshake or tea? A tea. A tea? Yeah. Yeah? What do you want? I don't know. Same as you. Yeah. Yeah.  My friend Brodie has Down's syndrome, and she's mute and deaf, but she signs, and I sign a lot, and we're like this. You know, can't separate us. And we cause... We get told we cause a lot of trouble, and... You know, we just don't follow the rules. Oh, look, Brodie, boy! You like him?  You gonna talk to the boys? Come on. Come on. Come on, talk to the boys. No, you! You! Hey.  Want to talk?   Hello. Come here.  I don't know their names.   Cheeky. You're cheeky. No, you're cheeky.  A lot of things happen when me and Brodie go out.  I just think she's this amazing person, and she's absolutely amazing to be around. I just find it sad that some people just look at her for, you know, what she looks like, and just, uh... you know, judges her. Yeah, you're cheeky.  Hello. Um, my name is Ruth Garlick, and, uh, I'm 22 years old, and, um... I'm primarily a deaf autistic. What's this? Oh, this is my baby snake Cleopatra. She helps me to stay calm. And it means I don't have a lot of sensory overload when I'm handling her. Oh, sure, um... My ideal... ideal partner would be a blondie who's a big cuddler. He also needs to be able to be okay with my quirks and my nerdiness. He's just over there. Come along. Hey, gorgeous. Hello. I'm Thomas. We've been, um, dating for... about four years now, and I think we do all right together. She's funny, fun to be with, um... r-really smart... a-a-a killer body, and just puts up with me. Yeah, he loves my body, that's why he stays with me. I... I really do. It's sexy. Sexy. I think we do work well together. I'm autistic enough to understand Ruth, and she can understand me back. Likening it to curry, she's a very spicy chicken tikka masala, but I'm... I'm a nice... nice mild, um, butter chick... No, I'm a... I'm a mango chicken. I've decided I want to be a mango chicken. Yeah, so basically, I'm fire, and he's water. And together, fire and water, things get steamy. That's very naughty. Yes, it is. just over a year ago.  This is my card collection. This here's thick. So it's quite heavy. This is one of my favorite sections, which is food.  Yes, I do. at how many you have? How many? Um, probably thousands. Look, there's... This is a lot. I can't wait to sort them all out. who collects business cards. Well, autistic people are known for being pretty unusual.  This is my garden railway. A garden is your own idea of heaven. So, of course, mine's gonna have a train running through it. My sister told me that, um, she knew another aspie at church, and, uh, she wanted me to meet him, because she thought we'd become friends. We immediately understood each other. We... And I actually... When we first met each other, I wrote in my journal, ""Oh, I want to marry this guy."" I didn't know that. That's true. I told you that before. That's why I need to go buy some. That one? Ruth drew that for my birthday. ""Happy birthday, Tom, from your crazy girlfriend Ruthy."" And then that is, um, runes.  Can't wait to marry you. I love you, Ruth. Apparently, it says that. If I actually was dating somebody, and I actually entered a relationship, and then eventually... married her, I would treat her as my top priority. She would be pretty much my most valuable and greatest treasure of all time. She'd practically be my million dollars.  Yeah. You mean the sea salt? Yep. Please. finding it hard to meet someone? I think he just needs to find somebody that's like-minded. I don't think he wants anybody loud. Or gothic. Mm-hmm.  Or tomboyish. Mm-hmm. Or practically any girl that acts like... like she's still in high school. Yeah. Sounds right. If she's the right person for me, then... I'll... I'll consider proposing to her. Okay. By coincidence, I've already decided on the perfect wedding ring for my partner. In the form of a crown... to signify that she'll be my queen, per se. But I'm not really too keen on kids at the moment, because...  I have a feeling that having children will ruin my chances of becoming wealthy. They kinda do.  But what if you meet a girl that wants to have children, and you're like, ""Oh, but that's gonna take away from my bank account."" What are you gonna do? I'll simply tell her, ""Okay, I'll allow it, but on one condition. I get a vasectomy after the second child."" Okay. I've been single for 25 years. I'm not too willing to be single for another 25. What if you are? Mum. I still refuse to take that for an answer. But it's not an answer. I'm just saying, it's a hypothetical what-if. Not what if. It will. Okay. That's it. Not what if. It will. It will.  who works with people on the spectrum.  When they're children, there's a lot of support given to people with autism about social skill and social interaction. And I think when people reach adulthood, and they're really looking for intimate relationships, I think that we don't give a lot of support to understanding the really great complexity... ...of flirting with somebody else, or how do we develop an intimate relationship with somebody else? Hello.  Hello. You must be Jodi.  Yes, hello. Are you Michael? Yes, I am.  Where do people meet each other when they're on the autism spectrum? People go onto sort of a mainstream dating site, and then do you out yourself as being on the spectrum, which is really complex?  I've never had a partner before. I've always had some trouble trying to find a partner. Why do you think that is? Well, a lot of girls that I've been friends with in the past, a... a lot of those friendships have turned out to be quite...  disappointing. Do you have trouble with understanding another person's body language? I have very little trouble. Facial expressions always give something away. That's great. It's excellent that you say that. Because some people on the spectrum, they really have difficulty with that. So that's excellent that you've got that ability to do that. Yeah. Yes. When I'm with somebody, if they're trying to mask... mask something... ...on their face, I'll just simply say, mask it all you want, but I know what you're actually feeling. Really? He... And you know what, he's so good at it. He's so... Even with people he's just met. I've been studying human behavior for many years. That's excellent, Michael. Specifically in women. Yeah. Oh. It's because I've always taken a bit of an interest in it, in a... in a strange way. No, that's not strange. Do you know what, if you're on the autism spectrum, and you find body language difficult, actually studying body language is a really important thing to do. I was told that nonverbal cues, he'll never be able to get. Excuse me, nonverbal cues? Look at his gift. I was told, ""Oh, you know, you'll... you'll probably never hear him say I love you."" They said he probably won't have any empathy for others. Biggest bunch of rubbish I ever heard. It's just a difference in the way that they do things. They're just different, that's it. And people with autism have incredible affection... ...and deep love. Yes!  Really wanting to connect. When people talk to Michael, they might find him a bit of an oddball, a bit quirky, and stuff like that. But the thing is, we've raised him and taught him...  to be confident with himself, and that, you know what? Even as so-called ""normal people,"" we don't have all the answers. But you two have obviously done a really, really fantastic job as parents. They haven't given me everything. Not everything, but plenty. Which is still adequate. Which is still adequate?  Yes.  Yep. What's the difference between... friendship and a girlfriend? Girlfriends, they're more serious, it's more intimate, and there's no hands-to-yourself business. Okay, hang on, hang on. So, it's more... Because that's...  Tell me the difference. It's more serious... What do you mean by more serious?  When I say serious...  Yeah. ...you make the decision to... Yeah. ...to kiss each other or, um... We don't talk to Mum and Dad about kissing, do we? I never really thought about that. Because, you see, I've never... never had any interest in having... in having sexual intercourse as... if you will. Um... Okay, this is where I exit.   Yeah. I have to say, that could be a good time.  Thanks very much for coming. We'll leave you guys to it. And, like, one of my philosophies is, never fall for a girl just because she's hot. I think that's an excellent philosophy. I made that up myself. Did you? It's a good... It's a very good one. So, when we're going on a first date, what we're doing is we're trying to find out have we got enough things in... ...common. ...common. What would be one thing that you can think of if you could make a girlfriend, what would be something that you're into and that she's into?  There is a hobby that I enjoy doing. I actually tend to do this one in secret. That's toy collecting.  If you don't have enough things in common, what do we do? Not bother with another date. We don't just give up, we keep going, because we just have to keep finding... Yeah. ...that person that's gonna be your person with enough in common with you. Yeah. I'd really like for you to let me know how you go on your dates, and especially to find out if you've been able to find somebody that you have common interest with. Okay. It was lovely to meet you. Like... Likewise. Take care of yourself. See ya. And good luck. Thanks. Thanks for your time. who might have a disability or a condition? Oh, yes. And I think dating someone who's on the autistic spectrum, or someone, you know, with disabilities might be better. I might... I might have, um... be able to talk to them more about it and not feel like I have to be fake and be someone completely different. Hello. Yeah. If you need to, just, you know, twiddle your fingers or something, if you're getting a little bit nervy. And you can always excuse yourself, you need to powder your nose or something. Okay, but I don't have nose powder. No, no. It's... It's a saying, isn't it. You go for... go for a wee.  Oh, okay. But it's not honest. I'm just gonna just pop to the bathroom.  Okay. And you can have a little bit of time. Okay. All right? Just... Just ask him what he likes, and... boom, if there's a connection, it's a connection. between his toes. Hello.  Hello. I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Here you go. Oh, thank you so much. They're lovely. Thank you.  Thank you. So, how are you? I'm pretty good.  Yeah? You nervous? Yeah, I am. What do you like? Do you have any hobbies? I like to go to, um... to the gym.  Oh, gym? To be honest, I have never set foot in a gym. Mmm. Yeah. So, do you like reading? Like, do you know any good books? I do read sometimes, but not a lot... Yeah. ...because, um... Well, actually, I didn't learn how to fully read until I was 13.  Oh, really? Yeah.  I couldn't speak until I was seven. I still have a lisp, but I'm deaf, so... Oh, okay. Autistic, deaf. Yeah.  Yeah. Can't speak properly. Yeah, the whole package, I guess.  Um... Do you want to go inside for dinner? Yeah, sure. Okay. Oh, she's pretty cool. You know, it's going pretty well so far. I hope it can... only go up from here, you know? So, have you ever, like, dated before? Never. Oh, never? Never. This is the very first one... Oh, really? ...I've ever had, ever. Oh, really?  Yeah. Yeah. So, are you interested in, like, any specific type of person or... I thought I was interested in guys at one point, but then I tried watching a little bit of, uh, gay porn, and... It didn't... It didn't work out. No? Okay. And I did not like what I saw.  Oh, okay. And I didn't feel anything. So, you're sure you're definitely straight?  Yeah. Yeah. How about you? Um, well, I'm openly bi, but I dated, uh, a few girls before, a few guys, it's just, you know, I'm just trying to find the right person.  True that. Yeah. It's like, um... I like Asians.  Yeah. Okay.  I'm a... I'm an Asian, and... Okay, yeah. I'm not Asian. Okay. I also like Mexicans. I like them, too.  Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah. My, um... Oh. Um, the steak and the... and the chips. Fish is right over here. Thank you.  Thank you. That's what I'm talking about.  Do you like Spider-Man? Yeah, I do. Who's your favorite Spider-Man? Um... Tobey Maguire.  Oh. That is my favorite.  Oh, you see... I quite like Andrew Garfield, but I think Tom Holland, the current one, he's all right, but... Yeah, he's, um... No, he's an actual kid, so...  He's okay. He didn't tickle my fancy.  I guess... Hmm.  Hm. This has been a really nice date, but I think it's getting a bit late. Thank you. Yeah. I had a nice time tonight. Thank you. Thank you for the flowers, they're lovely.  No problem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye! Goodbye.  Bye! There wasn't really, like, a spark, and it was a bit awkward for both of us. It's kind of been, like, a learning experience, made me realize I like girls a bit more... than men. What'd he say? Are we in love? Um... We're a bit more than in love. Because we were a bit desperate, when we hit rough roads... ...we just decide to cling on even more. It's just nice and warm and comfortable and stable now, I think. Steady. Yeah, yeah. We're comfortable farting in front of each other. Yeah, that. Hello, Munchkin.  I've struggled my whole life with friends, and I've mostly really had friends of the animal, imaginary kinds. It would be nice to have a real-life friend, I guess, but I don't know if I will find one. So, for the moment, I've basically just latched onto Tom. That... That one wasn't good enough. We have to do it again. No, we don't! Yes, we do.  I love my job. It's really relaxing just driving around, looking at the scenery. Initially, as a railway enthusiast, I was a bit, ""Ew, buses, they're common."" Very, uh, snobbish of me. But I then thought, you know, while I couldn't find work, maybe give them a try. And here I am, and I absolutely love it, uh... Best job I've ever had. Just around the corner is a house Ruth and I are currently dreaming about buying. Really nicely located next to the railway station. It'd be nice to spend the afternoon on the balcony, just watching the buses and the trains driving past. I saw the bus come along, and I just jumped on...  ...and then, for some reason, Tom was in free dress...  ...and I had no idea why. Aren't you supposed to be in uniform? What? What? What?! Serious? Yeah. I told you I couldn't afford a ring. I already bought it. Really? Yeah. Really?! Oh, for goodness' sake, just put it on!  Come here.  When it comes to physical beauty, my idea is, a woman has to be beautiful, but not to the point where she looks like a model on a runway. Definitely not. That's too beautiful. Pretty much a fifty-fifty-looking girl. That would be the best. by a local disability organization.  Hi, Michael. Hello, Tamika. How are you?  I'm good, yourself? I'm great. So, what are your hobbies? Ten-pin bowling, pool, um, watching television... Nice. Now, that's nice. Yeah. And what are yours? Mine is basketball, soccer, football... Ever since I was a little girl, I always used to love sport. Ah, so you're a bit of a tomboy type. Correct, I am. Ah. Who's got the Mediterranean pasta?  Here. Thank you. That's me. Thank you. Oh, have any of you seen Yes! If only you could see how stupid you sound right now."" ""I love money! Money, money, money, money, money."" The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab."" to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy! And what could be better than serving up smiles?""  Mm-hmm.  Are you a beer drinker, Michael? Nope.  No? I've always hated beer. I don't even drink wine either. I hate it. Oh, wow.  You see, I'm a different kind of man. I'm actually a teddy bear. Aw, that's nice. I like that. Hello. Hello. Name's Michael. Nice to meet you, Michael. I'm Carli. Nice to meet you, Carli. What do you do for work? Um... I... I run my own business. Wow. But sometimes there have been complications. Like, the financial side on the business, it's... become a bit, not blocked, but clogged up. You know what I mean? Yeah.  But I've asked a friend of mine, ""Ah, can you fix that?"" ""Yeah, I'll fix it, I know what it is."" Ah. So, I can easily deal with that, 'cause see... Yeah. For instance, I've gotta do it tomorrow morning, because I've... Probably tomorrow afternoon. See if I can keep going on the... on the business stuff. But if it has to wait till the weekend, and then she sees it and goes, ""Oh, yeah, I gotta fix that again."" Yes. So, it's a bit frustrating. Hello. Hi. My name's Michael. Michael. My name's Amanda. You have a very lovely bow. Thank you. And your hairstyle looks lovely as well. Thank you. And, so, tell me, what are your hobbies and interests? I like to collect toys and dolls and things. Seriously? Yep. That's what I like doing as well!  Really? I've collected a lot of Thomas the Tank Engine... You like Thomas the Tank Engine? Yeah. I liked it when I was a kid. Yeah. I still like it a bit now.  Yeah. Do you have a favorite Thomas character? No, there's too many of them.  Yeah. So, how old are you? I'm 25. I'm 21. Have you had your birthday yet? Thank you. No, it's next week. Oh, so you're 22? Yeah, nearly. So, you were born in 1997. Same year Men In Black was released. Is that a movie?  Mm-hmm. Yeah. You've heard of Asperger's? Yes. I actually have it. So do I. But mine's mild. So is mine. Wow.  I was 13 when I got a diagnosis, so it was my first year of high school. I never knew I had Asperger's until my mother told me when I was 13. That's not too bad. Did she know when you were younger, though? I think so, but I don't know when. Yeah. When I was in primary school, I often sat alone. Yeah. Do you mind if I ask you something? Yeah?  Um... I actually enjoy... enjoy talking to you. Me too. I'd like to catch up with you again sometime. You never know... What do you say? Nice. Hello. What'd he say? How is Cleo? She's all right. She had a shed last night. Do you want me to show you the s-skin? All right. Got a surprise for her planned. She doesn't know yet.  It's the skin. I'm very proud of my little girl. about four years together? Yeah, it's cool.  No need to sound so excited. Sorry, I'm just... quietly elated.  You're a goose. It's like making out with Medusa.  Hello. Congratulations on your fourth anniversary. What's going on? We're going on a date.  Is that a Rolls-Royce with coach doors? This one's a vintage 1928 Chrysler. What did he say? It's a Chrysler, but we won't hold that against him. No, we won't.  Thanks very much. My pleasure. Do you have a business card? I do.  Thanks. Can I have one? You sure can. There you go. Brilliant! Thank you so much. My pleasure. Enjoy your evening. Cheers! What the...?  Oh.   Hmm. Yeah. Isn't this nice? It's very à la The Bachelor. But it's still very cute. Well... Well, very Bachelor, because it's entirely scripted. Didn't you get it? No! Who didn't email Ruth her script? I wish I saw the warning signs when I met you.  I never professed to be a lady. Good. Oh, that hurts. Oh. You're a cutie patootie. And you have a cute patootie as well. Thanks.  You're a really special girl, Ruth. You're very different and very unique. Well, you're a handsome boy. I am a handsome boy. You are. I'm a bit nervous, but excited. Hopefully it'll be love at first sight, or whatever. You know, like in the movies. Hi, are you Chloe? Oh, yeah, I'm Chloe. Are you Lotus? Yeah. Hi. Hi, nice to meet you. Hi. Would you like to sit down? Yes, please. So, um, what kind of stuff are you into, like, movies and stuff? Um, I sort of... I like Sailor Moon, you know, the anime. Oh! I love Sailor Moon.  Yeah. Me too. I kind of stopped watching it for ages, and then got back into it.  Oh, it's raining. Okay, I'm gonna put my jacket on. I'm just getting cold. Yeah. So are you, like, bi or lesbian? Yeah, I'm bisexual. I'm both. Okay. Yeah? I thought I was, like, a lesbian for the biggest time, because I didn't feel any attraction towards boys. Yeah. I started to think, maybe it was 'cause the boys at my school were gross.  Um... So, are you on the spectrum, too? Yes. I didn't get diagnosed until I was, like, 12. 'Cause, you know, sometimes with girls on the spectrum... It's harder to... Yeah, you get diagnosed later. Hello. We've got a mixed berry smoothie. That's me, thank you. And the iced... And the iced choccy. Thank you. No worries.  Yeah, it was kind of weird. When I was acting out, they didn't know what was wrong with me. They thought I was doing that because my parents got divorced. Oh. They were always like, ""The kid's just going through a phase."" Like, I had sensory problems, so I couldn't wear the socks, and I couldn't wear the sweater, and the school was like, ""Oh, she's just being annoying...""  Oh, yeah. Yeah, and... I was hated at my school, absolutely hated, because I would... No one knew, really, what to do. So, there's a sunflower farm, um, down the road. Would you like to go and pick sunflowers? Oh, yeah, sure. What's your favorite flower? Well, my name's Lotus, so... Oh, lotus. So probably a lotus. So, which way's the sunflower park? Oh, down there. Alrighty.  I wore the wrong shoes for this. Oh, so did I. Oh, God.   Not to be lame, but this reminds me of Minecraft. Oh.  Haha, yes, the autistic girl likes Minecraft. This is cool. Like a little hidden spot.  Yeah. Feel that. Kinda hurts.  Uh... I think it's going well. You know, a lot better than I expected. I really like her, you know. We're, um, talking, getting along. I was expecting, you know, sort of awkwardness, and that we wouldn't have anything to talk about and... Yeah, but we've just been non-stop talking.   Got it, thank you.   I think I got a little bit nervous, and I have trouble talking when I'm nervous, but I'm hoping that maybe she got that. I just hope she knows that's the case, and not that I was like, ""I don't wanna be here."" you could potentially date? Yes. Yeah, um... Yeah, it'd be cool if she thought the same thing. That looks like a little love heart. Oh, it does! Yeah.  Quite cute.  Yeah.  Are you... Are you all right? Oh, yeah, I'm good, sorry. I'm just spacing out. Um...  Alrighty, um... Uh... Do you want this one? Oh, no, you can keep it. Really? Yeah. Okay, thank you. It's cute, I'll put it in my vase.  Yeah. Um, well, my mum's here to pick me up. Uh... It was really nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you, too. It'd be cool to see you again. Oh, yeah. I would really like that. Oh, really? Okay, cool. Really, yeah. I was really worried, I didn't know if you liked me. I was... I was worried too, but that's really good. All right, um... Thank you. See ya! Bye! Goodbye. Bye. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Oh, I can't stop smiling. the perfect relationship? Well, no relationship is perfect, because perfection in a relationship cannot exist in any way. But you can make a relationship a very healthy, stable, loving relationship. And whenever a person is feeling bored or unhappy in their relationship with someone, all they need to do is stop and do one thing that everyone should do: smell the flowers. They don't bloom every day.  That's what I wanna hear. Jeez, I love your shoes, mate. Thanks, Dad.  Yep. Speaking of which, this bit of paper that Adam gave me, I'll be keeping this on my person. What is it? Just dating points. Oh, okay. Dating advice. ""Be yourself, above all else. Remain focused on your date. Look for changes in the way she responds to indicate if she's interested in the conversation. If she gives you short responses with a flat tone, take this as a sign to change the topic. Keep your face relaxed while maintaining eye contact.""  Indeed, he is. He gets it off me. Most guys wouldn't even think about all that sort of stuff. I wonder why. Because that's the way we've been created, I guess. Yes, but I want to be different from all men. In what way? An A-plus partner looks like me. I'm saying it because it's accurate, Mum. Yeah.  Far-out, Mike. And... He's cute. ...when I do get married in the future, not only will my wife be my most crowning achievement, but also, I've actually envisioned a lot of family members in the future saying this... these words to my wife af... after my passing. What the hell? After your passing? ""Being your husband... nothing made that man any happier."" You're thinking too far ahead, mate. Dad, I always think ahead. Excuse me, everyone. I need to do my final preparations for the date. Thank you. So cute.  Okay, which one? Ah-ha! I know, I'm coming. I won't forget that either, Mum. No problem. Nope. I never forget that, either. My... My hair comb. Um, just... Just bear with me for a couple of minutes. We'll be there, we'll be there! Ready. Yep, ready. Good stuff. All right, well, all the best, Michael. Good luck. Thanks, Dad. Thank you. Take care, Dad. Yep, see ya, Dad.  See ya.  Got it! Got it. Ah, thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Would you like some table water? Uh, yes please, thank... thank... Please and thank you. Just can't believe that this is happening. Little nervous."
Love On The Spectrum,01,02,"I've never actually dated anyone for years, ever since I left school. Little nervous. Just butterflies. She won't see it there. Hey! Hello, Amanda.  How are you? Oh, please, allow me. Thank you. I'm...  How have you been? I'm good. How are you? I'm very good as well. And, um... this is for you. Oh! I love flowers. You do? Yes. Thank you. It's my pleasure. You know, I used to study flowers. I never knew that. Yeah.   Hmm. So, um, what's been happening? Been working. Yeah. Pretty sure. What have you been up to? Not a lot, just work as well. Yeah.  Mmm. Okay.  Mmm. Mmm. The last time we met, you said that you love cats, right? And you also said... Ah, thank you. Thank you. And, so what other hobbies do you have? I've got birds I look after, and I like to do a thing called cosplay and go to conventions. Comic conventions? Yeah. I do too! Really? Yep. Yeah, have you been to one before? Yes, the Oz Comic-Con. I've been at that one. Have you been to any others? No, just that. Yeah? So, what else? Hmm. Might have to come back to that one...  Uh... I wanted to ask you, when is your birthday again? I had it on Wednesday. Oh, I missed it. Yeah. When's yours? Twentieth of March. Same month as my cat's. Yeah. So, how many birds do you have? About 12... I think. I used to have more.  Oh. So they flew away? Yep. Hmm. That must have been saddening. It's all right. You just learn from it. I'll be back, okay? Yeah, that's fine. That's fine.  Oops. Yeah. Amanda, to help you feel better?  I think it's too formal. I can't do this. It's just bad anxiety. Um, Cian? Cian? Hmm? Did I go too far?  Too far? With... with the questions.  No, I don't think so. Not at all. Oh. 'Cause... she seems a little bit quiet.  Hmm. Um, here are your bag and your rose. Thank you.  This doesn't have to be a date. Yeah. We can just, um... have a friendly dinner as friends?  I think... wait, and I'll do another time. Yeah. Shall I s... see you to the... door? If you want to.  Okay. Well, it was lovely seeing you again, Amanda.  Mm-hmm.  Sorry how things turned out. It's okay.  I do feel bad. Don't feel bad.  I just feel like I may have gone too far with the questions.   Well, you take care of yourself, Amanda. You too.  And good luck. Yeah. Oh, well.  That's... That's life, I guess. Hi, I'm Maddi. I'm single, and I'm on the spectrum. I enjoy video games, books, and animals.  How would you describe yourself, Maddi? I'm a very independent person. Reasonably smart. Uh, quirky. Always seem to, like, stand out a little bit without even trying. Or I'm funny without trying, people tell me, so...   What's something you'd like people to know about you? That just because I'm on the spectrum, I'm not... I'm not... I'm not dumb. Some people can be really condescending, like, ""How... are... you?"" sort of thing. I'm like, please, come on.   How do you know when you're in love? Um, I can't really say for sure, 'cause I've never really been in love, but I can only go by what... like, what I've seen in movies and things, so I'm not really... Can't get into that too well, sorry.  Can you describe your ideal partner? Tall, muscular... rich.  So, what do you guys think about me dating? I think it's great if you wanna date. Maybe you should date, get married, and move out of home. Move out of home being the important one. Ah... Well, how would you react if I brought a boy home? I think we'd cheer. I'd have to vet him. Make sure he was suitable for you. Make him very uncomfortable. Like we did with Montana, when she brought her boyfriend home. Right. What do you think? If I ever date, it'll be a couple of years before he meets you guys, at least. Years?! Protect the poor guy for a little while, for God's sake. Oh! Okay, well what about tonight? Let's talk about tonight. Who's going? So, superheroes disco tonight, down at Darling Harbour. And what are you going as tonight? Look for a Superman girl. Yes. Maybe we look for a Batman tonight. Okay, we're focusing a bit too much on tonight. Well, I think you gotta start somewhere, and maybe we start with tonight. What do you think are the qualities of a man that you'd like to date? Rich, muscular, tall. Eight-pack. Like your mother landed. You need to lower your standards. muscular, eight-pack. You don't go to the gym. Where'd this eight-pack come from? It looks good. You don't go to the gym! I don't want someone flabby. Excuse you! You don't either. We were supposed to go to the gym today. I did go. There's no shame in being picky when it comes to love.  What?  Have I got this on backwards? These ones go down over your shoe. So, at the back, like... No, at the front, so turn it round. There should be an elastic thing... and socialize with her peers.  Okay, pull it up. Yep. I would like to see her have somebody in her life. Clearly, I'm not gonna be here forever. It would give me some comfort to think that someone's there to look after her and she's there to look after somebody else. There we go. Wow, that looks cool. Where's the mask? Did you put it somewhere? No, I've got the mask here. Thank you.  Do you ever worry that she will end up alone? Yeah, all the time. Mmm. All the time. That's good. Hello there. Ready to party. to bring people together You can't just dance with yourself, find people to dance with. Who do you know over here? This man here, you should be dancing with him. And he's tall... And a lot of money, he's Iron Man. If he's ugly, tell him to leave his helmet on. All right, I get... I get the point. I'll go talk to him. All right, guys. Whoa, hello.  Would you like to dance? So, Sean, are you enjoying yourself tonight? Yes. Okay. How old are you, Sean? Twenty-eight. I'm 24. I'm 28. That's good.  Tell me about yourself. What are some of your hobbies? Um... I'm trying to think. Hmm. Well, why... why don't I go first? My hobbies include video games... Yes. ...books, and animals. Yes. What about for you? What are some of your hobbies? Um, I'm trying to think. Do you like animals? Yes. Do you have any pets at home that live with you? Yes. Cat or a dog? I... I have a cat. Aww. I have a female cat named Marmalade.  Is she a nice cat? Yes.  Likes to play? Um... Should we head back inside, you think? Yes. Or would you like to stay out? Okay. Conga line! Conga line! Conga! Everybody in the conga line! Whoo!  So, Kelvin... you just checking your hair? Looking good?  Excellent. So, you're ready to start? I'm Kelvin. I'm 21. I have autism, a disability which helps me concentrate on one thing, rather than getting distracted by others.  So, you think your autism helps you to really focus on one thing. How old were you when you were diagnosed with autism, Kelvin? Two years old.  Wow, that's pretty young, hey. Do you think you're different to other people your age? Yes.  How are you different? I have a different, uh, look in my face, and different personality from others.  How would you describe yourself? I'm caring, smart, gentle, considerate, and professional. We'll share it, Dad. Yeah, maybe we can share. Yeah. This is so delicious. Mmm-mmm.  Would you like to see Kelvin find a partner? Yes, definitely, yes. Being his father, yeah. Yeah, I'd really like to see if he can...  uh, have... have a date, and then girlfriend, have a partner, and then, even better, to have a family. That's nice, isn't it? A bit hard, but, uh, hopefully, uh, there will be a day that, uh, this is possible.  What's the hard part? What do you think will be difficult? I think it's the, like...  uh, for him to communicate with somebody which is at the same wavelength.  How did you feel when you heard that he was on the spectrum? Uh, devastating, but, uh, well, we have to come to terms, and we have to try our best, like, to help him. Yeah, that's what we did, like, all these years.  Are you proud of him? Oh, definitely. I'm very proud of my son, yeah. Hopefully, one day, he will... He will find his partner.Yeah.  Good to at least start with maybe a bit of practice. Hmm, yeah. Practicing what? Dad? Hmm? Practicing what? Uh, go out dating and seeing other, uh, people, and seeing ladies... Taking them out for dating, on dates? Yep, have dinner, go to the movies, yeah. Someone who is younger than you, Dad. Yes, of course, yes. For your dating, yes.  What do you think love feels like? Love feels like when a man and woman get together, they'll make a perfect bond.  Do you think it's harder for people with autism to find... a relationship, to find a partner? Some of them. Some girls don't feel like dating with someone in disa... with disabilities.  What? What is it, Dad?  It's me, Cian. Can we come in?  Um, yes. This is a cute R2-D2 toy. Say hi, R2-D2. Beep-boop, beep-boop, beep-boop. And this is the poster of my year 12 formal.  Did you take a date to the formal? I didn't. I want to show you the drawings that I made. This is Chibi Tsuyu. Eating frog cake. This is Suzuha Amane. She's strong-willed, athletic, like the one that I'm looking forward to dating. This is my original character, Yuko Ezo. She likes jellybeans, miso soup, mackerel, and carbonated drinks.  So you made up that character? Yes. It's for my story.  Where is your story?  It's...  Wow, that is incredible. You wrote all this?  Yeah, I wrote it from my mind. I'll still keep on writing until I reach the end of this book.  I think that'll take you a while.  What...? Oh. T-That's enough. Excuse me. That's enough for now, okay?  Enough filming? Yes. Thank you.  We'll see you next time. Bye!  Hello, Jodi. How are things? Things have been pretty good. Just work and that's about it.  Last time I was down there, with somebody. About the date, it ended too early. My date got overwhelmed by the atmosphere. She had anxiety, and I was starting to get a bad vibe about things. I just told her that if she had to go, she was quite welcome to. That's really supportive. you were getting to know her?  Yeah, I was.  Yeah? What things We both love cats. She loves comic conventions, and I do as well. I'm actually gonna be seeing her on Sunday. We'll be going to a comic convention together.  Well that's excellent. with each other? Who knows? We might. you feel a little bit awkward Yeah. on the weekend. Yes, the Skipper off Gilligan's Island. Because... Because Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann on the show, will be there herself. She's pretty much the total package. She's not the hottest woman in the world, she's beautiful, but not extremely beautiful, but she's definitely polite, she's pure and very wholesome. That kind of woman is very hard to find. Which is unfortunate.  So, if you had a girlfriend, Yes. Yeah.  All right, well, just have fun.  Yep. Will do.  It was lovely to speak to you. Likewise. Thank you for your time. All right, see ya. Take care of yourself.  Would you say that you're different to other people? Well, yeah, 'cause I've got a disability, I'm on the spectrum, people are always gonna look at me as different from them, and I know I'm different from them, and that's fine, so... If we're all the same, the world would be pretty boring.   Would you like to go out with a guy who is also on the spectrum? Yes. partners who are the exact opposites of them. They've run out of things to talk about. How is that so? If you have lots in common, you wouldn't run out, it'd be endless conversations. So, I think... similar personality traits is quite good. for her very first date. Wow, you look great! Thank you, I know.  You've got your special necklace on.  Yes, it's a favorite. Your watch is even color-coded with your top, tonight. It's called ""successorizing."" Successoring? Success with accessories. Oh, I see. Oh, wow. Old people are so out of the loop, really. Excuse me! So, how are you feeling about tonight? Nervous. Your very first date.  Yes.  On Valentine's Day. I need a drink. You don't even drink! I don't care.  Can I take a photo? No. No. Can I take a photo? No! Please, let me take a photo of you. No, come on. I don't need to be fussed... I'm not gonna fuss. Just one quick photo. Please. Do not put it on Facebook.  No, I won't put it on Facebook. One... two... three. Okay. First date photo. Ooh! So excited! So excited! Please! Oh, God! No! God.  Have a good night. I'm nervous. This is why I don't want you there. Okay. All right, all right.  Leaving now.  Have fun! That's important. Have fun.  See ya.  Right, that's it, huh? She's off. She's launched. Oh, my goodness. I wonder if all the coaching... I'm gonna be so nervous for her. Hello. Hi. Are you Maddi? Yes. I'm Mark. Nice to meet you. Mark, nice to meet you. Happy Valentine's Day.  Thank you. I got these for you. Wow! Thank you. Great. And this...  Thank you very much. They're lovely! Thank you very much. Right. Oh. It's nice to meet you.  Lovely. Yeah. Okay.  So, how's your day been so far?  Oh, yeah, pretty good. Pretty good. Much better now that there's sweets. Oh, yes. I love sweets.  Ah. How are you feeling? Uh... Not too bad, actually. Pretty... Pretty good. Slightly nervous. But what about you, how are you feeling? I feel good. Really confident and excited.  That's good. Sorry to interrupt. Would you like to order food? For the main meal, I'll have the ravioli with ricotta and spinach. That would be nice.  And I will take... the gnocchi, please. The gnocchi? Thank you. Okay. Thanks for that. Thank you. Enjoy your night. Thank you. We will, thank you. Okay. What is your favorite thing in the world? Dinosaurs. Oh, yeah? I'm into paleontology, stuff like that. Into what, sorry? Paleontology. How do you pronounce that? Pal... Paleontology. Paleontology. Sorry, I haven't heard of that one. Paleontology. And that is? The study of prehistoric life. Oh! Yes. Cool, that's pretty cool. But I'm... Palen... Sorry. Palen... What is it? Pa-leon-to-lo-gy. Pa-leon... I'm sorry. No, it's all right, it's okay. Paleontology, okay.  Yeah. How's yours? It was nice, it was really nice. I love ravi... ravioli.  Mmm. You look beautiful. Very, very beautiful. Thank you, you look... you look quite nice your... yourself. Thank you. And that's a really beautiful necklace. You're very lucky to have that.  It suits you well.  Thank you. Thank you. I just wish this night didn't have to end. I can't remember when I've had this much fun. Yeah! It's been... certainly been... certainly been a very interesting evening, so...  Well...  Thank you. Thank you. Um...  Maybe we should dine and dash, what do you reckon?  No? You don't... don't like that idea? Subtotal... We could grab our stuff and run down the street. What... What... What did you order? The gnocchi. Shall we pay for ours separately or something? Uh... I've... I've got money, so, like... Would you like to split? How would you like it? Actually, um, I'll pay on this. Rest on the card?  Yes. Okay. Well, it's nice to meet you. It was nice to meet you, Mark. Thank you for... I hope we meet each other again. I had a great time, and I hope we can do this again. I had a good time too. It would be good to hang out... Yes. ...again, like... And I wish you all the best. Thank you. Thanks, once again. Thank you. See you. Have a wonderful night. Bye, Mark. Thank you very much for... You're welcome. ...the flowers. Thanks. You have a good night. You too. Bye. Bye-bye.  See ya.  How did the date go, Mark? Do you like Maddi? Oh, she's really nice and very sweet, and charming. I feel like she's the type of person that I'd love to spe... have spend my life with. Hi, sweetheart. Hey, Mum. How'd you go? Great. Did you have a lovely time? Oh, loved it. Lovely meal, and enjoyed the company? Oh, yes. Oh, she was spectacular. Beautiful? Oh, that's lovely, darling. She was a lovely woman. Yeah? That's awesome. Never had that much fun in one night. Can't remember the last time I ever felt this good. Oh, really? I'm so happy for you.  So, how was tonight, Maddi? Yeah, it was a good night. I had fun. We had lots to talk about. He seems pretty smart, so, yeah.  Yeah? Yeah, not many people interested in... paleontology. I think I've got that right. Hope that was right. Add the eight-pack, and that'll be perfection, so...   Do you think you're a romantic person? I will be.  How would you ask a girl on a date? If you liked someone, how would you ask them? Shall we go out for dinner together? Or should we have some... Shall we go out for a party... and dance to the music together? It'll be fun. has come to meet Kelvin Often when I meet people for the first time, I'm really checking to see what their ability is with initiating conversation. Sometimes I won't say hello to start with. I'll wait and see whether they can actually initiate verbally. Because sometimes people can't start a social interaction. Cool, it's you. Jodi? Hello. Hey there. Welcome.  Thank you. Nice to meet you. My name's Kelvin. Nice to meet you, Kelvin. It's called the autism spectrum, because it's a spectrum. Come on, follow me.  There is not two people on the spectrum where their autism presents in the same way. It is so diverse. And that's its beauty. It doesn't matter whether you're on the spectrum or not, everybody has a basic human right and a basic human need for connection and love. So... here's the girl. Why do you want to have this girlfriend? Because we... Because she's nice.  What will you and the girlfriend do together? Together... we should go out on... a date.  Yeah? What else do girlfriends and boyfriends do? Hug and kisses?  Hugs and... yeah. Hugs and kisses. So, would you like to do hugs and kisses? Yes.  Yes. When we go on our first date with somebody, what do we do on date number one? We should introduce her by name... first. What if the girl wants to sit down at the table? What would you... would be a good thing for you to do? Good thing... Like this, so you and I, I'm... I'm... I'm gonna come... Pretend Dad's not there, 'cause we don't want Dad on the date, do we? What?   No way, Dad's not coming on the date. You show me what a gentleman would do if... if... Jodi's coming on... to meet you. Okay, you ready? Are you a gentleman?  Hi. Here you go. Here's your seat. you have to introduce... Hi, my name's Kelvin Wong. Nice to meet you. My... My interests are manga and drawing and computer. Okay, first of all, you want Jodi to sit down, so we're on the same level. Don't we?  Yes. Okay, so here's my chair here. Try again.  Okay. Okay, you ready? Here I come... Hi, Jodi, my name is Kelvin Wong. Nice to meet you. Hello, Kelvin. My name's Jodi. Then the chair. Let her sit down. Uh... Here's your chair. No, go out and take the chair, and then... Go out and take... No. No, Kelvin. Stand up, get the chair out, and let the lady sit down. And then you say, here's your... Here's your chair, Jodi. Thank you very much. No, now you have to... That's a good... When... When the girl... She might already be sitting, but remember, before you move onto talking about yourself, we always do greetings first. Greeting. Greeting. Now, how... how are we going to start talking with the girl about... common interest? Common... Common inter... If you just start talking about... ""Hi, I'm really into computers, and I really like games and my iPad."" No! Okay. So the girls really like it... if people, boys, the first thing they do is ask them...  A question. Perfect. Because then the girl thinks... ""Kelvin is really interested in me."" What would be a good first question that you could ask her? Ask her... What are your interests? Oh, nice one. What are your interests... Perfect! ...by the way. Perfect. So what about if she comes back and she says, ""I love animals and everything about animals.""  Ooh.  Cutie, indeed. And they are so cute like toys. They are like toys. What about... And then the girl might ask you a question... Do you like animals? I meant, I'm also interested in animals. We should go to the koala park. You're fine... Well, that was nice. Why were you suggesting that you go to the koala park? It's because she likes animals. I'm really proud. That is excellent. If she likes something that you don't like, is that okay? So, say she says, ""Oh, my favorite anime is...  Yeah, uh, I used to... What if she goes, ""I like...""  I used to watch it, but not anymore. Not anymore. So is that okay that she likes different anime and manga than you?  Yes, like, I get that Ouran High School is bad taste, and I shouldn't watch it, because of... 'cause it has mature themes. Okay. So, we started talking about anime. What did you do with your body? Uh... Looking away. You're looking away. And that's a no.  Exactly. We've gotta keep the conversation being... Fifty-fifty.  Fifty-fifty. So, if you turn away and start talking to yourself about your manga... It's not a good thing. It's not fifty-fifty, is it? I have to go to the bathroom.  I'll be back. It's good that you come in and, like, show him all this. Like, it's very, very useful for him. Sometimes, like, man to man, it's difficult to get over to him. It's very hard. Do you know, I think this is stuff that... This is all the... the really simple things...  Mmm. Um, that we forget are so important about social skills. Mmm-hmm, yes. But when you get to 21, almost 22, and he's desiring to have a relationship, it's very hard for a dad to do that. Yeah, yeah. Isn't it? I find it really hard for me to... Yeah. My job just is teaching people who are ready for... Um... ...dating and relationships. Yeah. And... Uh, for next one, I'll ask her what movie we're watching. Oh, have you been thinking about that? Oh, I... I was thinking. So, the most important thing about the first date is... Is the... Is, um... Greet her! Greet her. And what are you trying to find out? You're trying to find out... what you have in... What? In common. Perfect. You have to have some things that are the same... but you're allowed to have some things that are... Different. Perfect. I think your dating's gonna be good. Just remember, we go up the steps... slowly. Take it easy. Take it easy. I think for Kelvin, the challenge is just gonna be the beginning. Challenges of social skills with another person. He's at the really beginning journey of understanding what it is to be with another person and what that feels like, and has to go through all the things that we all go through. The rejection, finding out whether we've got a good match with somebody... At this stage in his learning, it's... it's about practicing. Just getting out there and giving it a go, and finding out who's a good match for him. Out you go, Jodi. I'll see you anytime. Okay, see you, Kelvin!  See you!  Hey, bud. Hey. How'd it go?! How'd it go?! Tell me all about it! Calm down.  How did it go? Yeah, fine. He was a very nice guy. Really? What did he look like? Oh, you've got a photo? Yes, I do. Perfect! Oh, he's very nice. Yeah. Yeah... Are they the flowers that he brought you?  Yeah. That was a nice touch, white roses. Yes, yes. What did you do when you got the roses? I said thank you and hugged him. You hugged him?! Yeah, like... Show me. Show me what you did. Just like that, sort of thing. Oh! I can do it properly standing up. Oh, that's a good thing. Don't make a fuss, honestly. No, everything was okay? All right, tell me all about him. What do you mean? Well, do you want to see him again? Yes. Perfect. I think he looks like he's good son-in-law material. Off you go, thanks. Off you go. Goodbye.  Parents, honestly...  Jeez, Louise.  Do you feel like you've got a lot of love to give? Yes. All the people I know and care about, they know me for my... for my large heart, which was once described as... ten sizes too large. Aha! There she is. Hello, Amanda. Hey! Good to see you again. Good to see you. What are you dressed up as? My character name's Riko. From what? An anime called Love Live! Ah.  Yeah. Right. What's the book you've got? Oh, that's a cookbook. Is that part of your character? Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh. Actually, um... I wanted to see if I could get Dawn Wells to, um, autograph this. Okay.  Is there anywhere you wanna go? Uh, yes. Um, you want to check out a few places? Okay. Do you know much about Dawn Wells? No... Barbara Eden? No. Barbara Feldon? Oh. Then you probably haven't seen No. Or Get Smart. No... Mmm-mmm. Ah. Oh, look, there's one with a costume right now!  The genie? Yeah!  Look! Look!  I can see. That's her! Yep.  That's the costume. If you ever wanted to have lunch or dinner somewhere, we don't have to... have to go somewhere formal. Okay. We can go somewhere casual. Yeah.  Probably should've done that the first time. So, what do you wanna look at first? There is something I want to get. It's up this way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, no.  Everything okay? Don't you agree that that mask is creepy? Where? Right there, the guy with the dark hair. I refuse to watch those Halloween films. You don't like them? I hate 'em. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. They're too scary. A little bird tells me that you love plushes. I do. I've got lots of them. Yeah? Yep. I actually have a bit of an affinity for them myself. You like them too? I keep it secret, though. Oh.  It's because they're... They're not exactly something for men. How are you feeling, by the way? I'm okay. Are you sure? Yep. Not feeling anxious in any way? I want you to feel comfortable. That's all I care about right now. You recognize something? Does look like you.  Should we buy this one? Yes. Okay, then I'll get it for you.  Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. I'll just grab that, thank you. Thank you. There you are, Amanda. Thank you. It's my pleasure. It's a little gift from me to you. Well, I... I'll be heading off to, um, my... that autograph and photograph thing. Yep. So, right now, um... I have to say, it was really lovely spending time with you again. It was good to see you too. Thanks. Are you interested in, um, spending time together again sometime soon? I'll think about it. Okay, you just have the time to think it over. And, um, take care. See you later. And good luck.

You don't need to say it. Just in your mind. Just remember it, yeah?  Okay. Okay. Yeah.  Looks like I'll be having fun tonight."
Love On The Spectrum,01,03,"What do you think love is? It can make people do crazy things that they wouldn't think of doing, make them act all bizarre. I think it requires, um, communication, honesty, and compromise. with his dinosaur knowledge. Hey, Maddi. Nice to see you again. Good to see you. Hey. How are you? Good, and you? Awesome.  Haven't been here in ages.  Well, you're gonna love it. Here we are, lo and behold, the dinosaur exhibit.  Ooh.  You know who these guys are? They're raptors. Raptors. You might remember them from movies like Jurassic Park or documentaries. Oh, I couldn't watch those movies. I tried to. It's just too much violence and gore. It's like, oh, my God.  Check out that toe claw.  Yeah, it's so long and sharp.  Yes. You could take someone's eye out. And it's very good for killing its prey with. How about that, eh? Yes.  This one's from Africa, Nigersaurus. That's a Hypsilophodon. It's a cute little dinosaur. Sure.   When they discovered the Sinornithosaurus, it sent shock waves throughout the paleontological community. This is Maiasaura. The name Maiasaura means ""good mother."" Well, there you go. Yeah. This is the femur of the sauropod dinosaurs. Some of them are so big, you can't even wrap your arms around them. Here's my old favorite, Stegosaurus.  Stegosaurus. Minmi. Minmi? Yeah. It's an Ankylosaurus. Here's a really cool dinosaur. Cryolophosaurus. Oh.  Interesting fact. Tyrannosaurus Rex has the strongest, the most powerful bite of any other dinosaur.  Yeah. Truly a formidable predator.  Is it going well so far? Oh, yeah. I've hardly been... I haven't been... I haven't been able to get much, um, sentences in, because he's always just, like, saying something. But that's okay, like... It's fine, so... Ah, perfect.  That was love. Ah, this is perfect. Yeah, fabulous.  Such a beautiful place.  Yeah. Nice.  Just feel that breeze. It's like Mother Nature is giving you a nice welcoming kiss. Hadn't thought about it like that.  One day, um, Ma... Um, Maddi, one day, if you found the perfect guy, would you like to get married? Um... Well... Maybe, I think... I think that's kind of a question... when... when I find that someone... Yeah. ...and kinda if. Do you feel anything about me? Um...  I know... Oh, jeez. Um... Yeah. Oh, look... I think you're a very nice guy, very smart, and very interesting. Yeah. And very good friend material. Yeah. I just... There's no romantic feelings, like... That happens a lot. But, uh, I think you're beautiful. You're smart as well. Oh, thank you. And you... you're very enthusiastic. I think you have excellent friend material. There's nothing wrong with being friends. Yeah, yeah. You know... At least I made a new friend. Yes, yes. That's the wonderful gift of life. Yeah.  Well... Okay. It's been a wonderful day. Yeah, it has been quite an experience. I wish you all the best. Thank you. I hope you take care of yourself. I wish you all the best for the future. You too. All right. You as well. Okay. Well, goodbye. Bye.  I've never had romantic feelings for anyone. And I'm not sure, like... if it hasn't happened by now, it might not happen, you know? So, like... Like, maybe it will happen if I meet the right person, but, like... And because I never experienced it, maybe I don't know how to read the signs, or... pick up the emotions, or whatever. Hey, Mark. Hey, Dad. Great, we had a wonderful time. Great? Well done. Good on ya, fella. So, what happened? Well, we... we're not really... compatible. Oh, okay. That's fine. We always said that might be the case. Yeah. Well, to be honest, I feel a little bit sad. Yeah, I understand. And so, you left on a good note, though? Yeah. A happy note? We're both friends, so... Right. That's all we can... That's all we can ask for. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? Ready to go home? Yeah. It's been a long day. Yeah. Okey-doke, let's go. All right, shall we check this place out? Oh, it's amazing. in his search for love. for some dating advice.  Good thing this table's free. Yeah, this is the best one in the place. What's going on in your life at the moment? You've been searching for dates? Yeah. Maddi was a nice person. But... unfortunately, we didn't have any romantic spark between us. Oh, man. We were more keen to friends. That's me. Thank you. You're welcome. Cheers for that. That is interesting. Ah, yes, nothing like a nice cup of tea on a wonderful afternoon like this. That's true. And that banana smoothie looks really nice, I've got to admit.  So, what do you think girls like? Humor. Oh, yes, yes, yes. And I do think, to get a girl to like you, is to flatter them. Oh, yes, definitely. Because they have feelings just like we do. Would you prefer a girl who has the same interest in dinosaurs? That would be wonderful. Yeah.  It's a huge world. Anything is possible. I mean, I like dinosaurs too, but not an obsession. Well, I'm madly in love. I'm sure you are.  Yeah.  Mmm. Are you, uh, dating anyone? Not officially. Okay, right. Yeah. I'm still looking. Well, stay strong. You know, someone will come along and... will be right for you. Yes, my soul mate is out there, I just haven't found her yet. Yeah. It will happen. It will happen. It will happen. Yep. Are you on any dating sites, like Plenty of Fish or eharmony? Oh, yes, I've looked into dating sites. Even int... Yeah? Even international dating sites. International dating sites, interesting. I could picture myself with a, uh, Mexican girl on my right shoulder and a Russian girl on my left shoulder.   Yeah... I guess I'm the international lover kind of guy. Ah, okay. Yeah. All right. Well, that was great... Oh, sure. ...having time with you. Thanks. I had a wonderful time, and I hope we do this again. Oh, sure, my pleasure. You take care, Ryan. Pleasure, as always. Wish you all the best.  Thanks, you too. Have a good day. Good luck with your search.  I will. You too. Thanks.  See ya, Ryan.  See ya, Mark. Take care.  How do you feel about being on the autism spectrum? I have mixed emotions, you know. Even though I'm on the spectrum, I'm still capable of falling in love and being a compassionate and caring person.  And have you ever had a relationship? No.  So, falling in love is something you would like to do? Oh. For a long time, yes. It's always been on my mind, and it's just so hard to get. This is a skull of a Tyrannosaurus Rex, I'm very proud of it, you know. I basically worship it. This is by a paleo artist. This guy here is a grade A, bona fide dinosaur. It has a small sail on its back. In the mating season, you would want to show that off and say, ""Hey, baby, look at me. I'm the one you want to mate with.""  Can you describe for me your ideal partner? I like a girl who is very passionate, at the same time, a very... calm and caring nature.  What if she hates dinosaurs? No deal. Hey, Dad. Hey, Mark. How was work? It's been a busy day.  I bet. Hey, Mum. Yeah, I sure did. Good boy. I'm looking forward to Matt's wedding. Have we heard any more from Matt and Emma? I think in a few weeks, you'll be going on the bucks night. Yeah, that would be fun. Yeah.  Is your brother getting married? Mm-hmm. would you like to do that one day? Yeah. You can find the girl of your dreams. I think you'd make a great boyfriend. You're a beautiful person. Yeah. We're just amazed at how far he's come. It... I mean, it's been a hell of a long journey. Mark, in his young age, he had limited language, meltdowns, he was destructive. A lot of our friends who had children with autism, um, their marriages broke down, and, uh, ours was strained too. And so, I think I need people to know that you do need to work together, and you have to work hard, and I think that it's now paying dividends. Sorry.  because it has been a hard road, but we've seen light at the end of the tunnel. And we've seen Mark just come so far.  How would you describe your ideal girlfriend? Clever, intelligent, energetic, athletic, strong... brave, grateful. And she smells good.  She smells good. And perhaps has a... smell of orange juice, or... um... or... flowers.  That sounds good. Good to see you. I'm having Teppanyaki here for dinner with my date. All right, okay, just take a seat.  Nobody likes a dumb-dumb man. Don't be a dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb- dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb...  There she is. My name's Kelvin Wong. Hi, Kelvin. Nice to meet you. What's your name?  I'm Jessica. Nice to meet you. Here... Please sit down.  Thanks, man. Wait, that's...  Mmm, hmm. You smell good. Yeah, it does. Okay. All right. What are your interests? Oh, uh, I like video games and, uh, computer. I actually brought my Switch today, if you want to play Smash. Um... When? No, as in, while we wait for the server to come over. I hate waiting. You hate waiting? What, wait, um... I am... I am waiting patiently. Um, okay. Damn, this is... What about anime? Or manga? Oh, I don't really... read or watch much anime, but I do prefer video games. I'm just gonna switch this on for you. Oh, excuse me, any... you like movies? Oh, uh, I do like to go see movies from time to time. So... do you like animals? Oh, I... I like animals. Ooh. All right, just hold your controller sideways like this. All right. Thank you. And do you like cooking? Uh, no, I'm not a huge fan of cooking. Wait a minute... Ah... I know how to do... what? What? I lose.   Well...  Aw. Oh, you... I guess you're not very good at this game, huh? You can't really rejoin. Sorry about that. Sorry, it's a shame. Shame, it's... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I thought it'd be good to entertain ourselves. What? I thought it'd be good for us to entertain ourselves. What?  Hello. Hello, how are you?  Okay. All right. some prawn...  Ooh. ...fish, chicken... beef, and fried rice. All right! Yummy! So, now I cook the seafood first. Ooh, fish! Ooh. Cutting up prawn. I did read that you had to cut out the head from the prawn when you cook them. Didn't think you'd have to cut out the guts, too. Ooh.  Ooh! Ah, wow. You're so smart! All right, please try prawn first. Thank you.  I will burn myself. Yeah, what he said. Bon appétit. Yummy. Mmm. Not half bad.  Fire? Ready? One, two, three, go!  Oh! Hoo, Jesus Christ! It is a fire. Fire, yeah. Kelvin, you've been speaking a lot of Japanese. Yes, I've been speaking Japanese for three years. all right? Can you catch your bowl first? Two hands. Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. One, two, three... Catch! Good, yes. Oh, I-I learned it from my teacher, Travis-san. Ah, nice! Every Wednesday or Friday. Yes. Two hands on the bowl. Good. Yes. Yes. All right, ready? Catch, all right? One, two, three... Catch! Good. All right. Yeah.  Thank you. How do you make eating with chopsticks so easy? I'm a Chinese boy. And I come from a Chinese family. Oh. But I was born here in Australia.  I hope you don't mind me making a mess. I'm just trying to get used to these. How do you make them work so well for you, Kelvin? What is it? What is it you're talking about? The chopsticks. The chopsticks, oh. Copy me. No, not like that. Oh, yeah. Use your thumb in front of the chopsticks, only the thumb.  Oh.  Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, thank you.  Oh... Um... You're welcome. So... Do you like koalas? I do like 'em. And one day, would you like to go to the koala park with me? I would like... I actually would like that. How about Taronga Zoo? Where, Taronga Zoo?  Mm-hmm. That's a... It's in Mosman.  Have you seen the ambulance out there? What are they doing? I don't know, but it can't be good. I just hope they aren't coming in here, though. Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom, please. Can I go to bathroom, please? I'll be right back. Oh, okay.  Thank you. Be back.  What do you think of Kelvin, Jess? He's actually pretty nice, if you ask me. But he often had issues trying to understand me, and vice versa. Maybe it's because I'm not good at rolling my... R's, I can't do it. Cian, uh, Jessica's a very nice girl to me. She likes video games, movies, and traveling. And... But she doesn't like anime.  That's not true. Or manga. I actually do like anime, I just like video games more.  Why don't you go join her again and we can talk later, okay?  Okay. Anything you like most, other than video games? Oh, I like using the computer. Using the ""competter""? Yeah. What? Using the ""competter""? ""Competter""? The computer? I'm sorry, I don't want to be racist or anything. What, what? As in, you know, you said ""competter."" What? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not trying to be mean or anything, but... Competter? I'm sorry, but I meant computer. You know, laptop? The laptop. PC? Like my daddy uses. At home. Oh, heads up. All right, ice cream. Oh, caramel. Enjoy. Damn, that is good ice cream. You like yours?  Mmm, I like this. It was great going out on our first date together. Yeah, but don't automatically think we're gonna start kissing right now. Oh, oh, fine. Like, you're a great guy and all, but... I'm not ready to fall in love yet. You don't think I'm a g... You don't think I'm a great guy? No, I don't think... I don't think... You're not a bad person or anything. You don't feel like loving me? You know what? You're actually a great person. I'd actually like to hang out with you more as a friend. Not in the romantic way, just in the... platonic way. Platonic? Yeah. So, can I... add you to my contacts? Okay. And what's your phone number?  I'll just show it to you. Oh, that's fine.  Just type this. So, it's been a great time going on a date together. Yes. Hopefully, I'll get to catch up with you sometime soon enough. Okay, see you! Bye, Kelvin! Bye, bye!  Like, he's a really nice guy. I bet he'll find someone who loves him for who he is. But he kind of sucks at video games. She doesn't like manga or anime so much, but she likes video gaming more than that. It's better to be friends than being an official girlfriend.  What does love mean for you, Maddi? Well... love should mean that you stand by the person you're in love with, through thick and thin, and you don't bail... just 'cause you're bored. And it means, like, supporting them, and not just... not just turning a blind eye to when they clearly need help, so...  When are you happiest? With family. Family is like, um, brownies. They're a really sweet bunch, but you can't avoid getting a few nuts. Right!  Are we ready to get ready for the date? Yes, let's go get ready. Here are the pants. Uh-huh. Good.  Here's the shirt. Remembering that that goes to the back. Yes. People on the spectrum, they don't read the social cues that we all read. They get a lot of their social cues off television. And it was very early on I realized that I had to be the one she was getting her social cues off. Hey. How's it going? Oh! Oh, come around. Show me, show me, show me, show me, show me. Oh, that's good. Okay, how you feeling about it all? A tad nervous, but...  Do you wanna go through a rehearsal? Yeah, good idea. Steve, you're the barman. What are you gonna do when you meet him? Hi, nice to meet you, I'm Maddi. Oh, hi, Mad... Maddi, you don't need to... What? That's very hard. You've got a weak handshake 'cause you're old. Okay. Lovely to meet you, Maddi. Can I get you a drink? A lemonade, please. Lemonade. A lemonade, too. Thank you, barman. Two lemonades. So, you look lovely. Oh, thank you, you look decent as well. You look decent?   It depends on what his outfit looks like. What do you do for a living? I'm a jewelry designer. Yes. That job must rock. That's a good one! That's a good one! Your table is ready. Thank you. Maddison, would you like to go to dinner? Yes. Sit there, I'll sit over here with Steve. So, the idea is to keep the conversation flowing. Do you have any siblings? Uh, I have two sisters and two brothers. What about you? Two brothers and two sisters. And I have six nephews and lots of nieces. So, that's a lot of nieces and nephews... Do you want children of your own? No, never. When you're answer is no, you leave nowhere for the person to go. Because what you're trying to do is keep the conversation going. Let's try again. Do you want children of your own? No, because I think they're a waste of time and money. Good lord.  I don't know. What is that smile? Am I not allowed to smile?  No, people like smiles. Just be yourself, gorgeous. Just relax. You're telling me to keep the conversation going, but telling me not to tell people what they wanna hear, so I don't know how to combine those two. You can. You can still be honest, and... and say, ""Look, I don't think I'm ready for children. I may never be ready for children."" It just leaves it open. ""I may never""? I don't want to, like, put any maybe in there, in case he, like... I give him false hope. I don't want to, like, not prepare for it, and it comes up and I don't know what to do, so... cover everything. The chances of something coming up that we haven't covered is pretty high. We're gonna need to sit here for ages, then. No, we're not.  Yes, we are. You can't send me out there without being prepared. It is meant to be fun. Yeah, it is. Okay. So exciting, huh? Yes.   Are you a romantic person, Mark? Yes. Absolutely. And I just want to share my life with someone very special, and just show her the person that I really am, and to show her that my disability is not an obstacle, that I'm capable of falling in love.  If you do find love, how do you think you'd know? I feel like my heart skips a beat. My smile begins to beam. I just feel... entranced. set up for people on the spectrum.  The social club is about people with disabilities coming together, making friends, and having fun, which is very important, not just to me, but to everyone else that has a disability. Hi Mark, you came. Gonna sign up and play? Okay, cool. Yeah. How about you, Christina? You good?  I'm all right. You ready to have some fun tonight, guys? Oh, yes. Oh... no, no, no! What do you... What do you think about the new girls here? Yeah, they're nice. They're nice. I might like to talk to them a bit more later on. You know, get to know them better. So, how's your night been so far? You enjoying yourself? Yeah! Yeah, it's cool. I haven't bowled in ages, but... Yeah. So, do you have any family? Um... Well, yes, I have family. It's just me and my mum at home. Okay, I have a brother and a sister, and I have a mum and dad at home right now. And, uh, my sister will be... expecting soon in May. Oh, wow. I... I don't really care if it's a boy or a girl... ...as long as we're getting a new little... little baby child. Well, that's certainly happening. Yes. Oh. Ready to go. Righto.  Good luck, Presley. Thank... Oh, thank you.  We'll... We'll see.  Yes! Um, Presley? Yes? What are your interests in? I'm keen to know, what do you like? Um, I like to draw. Oh, that's great. Yeah, I really enjoy that. I like drawing nature and, like, animals and stuff. Oh, that's beautiful. Yeah. Very beautiful. What do you like to do? Play video games, watch movies, read books. Yeah. What movies are you into? Which ones are you into? Um...  Well...  Um, just... Uh, well... Just... Sorry, I'm... blanking out. Hang on, sorry. Excuse me for a second. That's okay. You all right?  Oh, God. Sorry. I just blanked out from nervousness. and just don't know what to say. Couldn't talk. Just... just... just be yourself, man. Just... just... And just... ask your questions, you know? Just build on those conversations. Right. Just breathe.  Come on. Hi, are you Severin? Hey. Yeah. Maddi, nice to meet you. You're Maddi. Yep. Well, you know, how was your day, I guess. Oh, yeah, pretty good. Pretty good, just catching up on... chores, errands, bits and pieces, so... Yeah. And your... how was your day? Um... Let's see... Well, um... had an appointment earlier, and... other than that, um... sprucing up a bit.  Ah. 'Cause, um... Well, yeah. Uh, so... Yeah... So, um... What do you like to do for fun? Oh. Uh, I... I love video games. I'm a huge video game nerd, so...  Nice, same. What kind of games do you play? I play The Sims 4. That's a great game. Yep. I'm the ruler.  Nice.  Yeah. Um... So... Yeah, um... Um...  Yeah. Um... So, um... Goodness me, listen to that noise. Wow. Screaming kids, that is horrible noise. It's like, be quiet. Um...  Thank God it stopped. Like, do you think you'd ever want kids one day? Like... Oh, it's... It's funny for me. Like, if you asked me maybe a year ago, I'd be like, ""No, I never want children, ever! Ever, ever!"" Like, that's what I was like, but I think as I've gotten older, like, I... Changed your mind a bit? Like, I've become more open to the idea. I don't really know if I'd ever want kids. I... I'm open to the idea, like, eventually if I was to find, like, the right person... Hmm, but yeah. Yeah, being open-minded, so... Yeah. Crumbs, I was afraid this would happen. It's starting to fall apart. Oh, whoa.  Oh.  Yeah. Ah... Oh.  Oh, yeah. Yeah?  Yeah. All good?  No worries. How was everything? Delicious, thank you.  Yeah, pretty good. Great. All good. Um... May I ask, what do you potentially think you want to do as a career one day? I think something with... something with animals. I did an animal studies course at TAFE.  Okay. Now I'm doing Cert III Music Industry at TAFE. The piano... Oh. ...specifically. Nice.  Um... Absolutely love piano with great burning passion, so... When I was in high school, and I heard a guy playing, I... I think it was actually the Skyrim theme on piano, Oh, wow. That's what sparked a bit of interest. And then I started, like, self-teaching myself. Wow. And um... yeah. I do have a surprise for you. Oh.  'Cause, did you know, there's a piano they have right here. Oh, my goodness. I didn't notice that on the way in, no.  Yeah. You like Skyrim, right? Yeah... Oh, I recognize that. Wow, like...  A bit improvisation, a bit... actual Skyrim.  Uh... Seriously, you are really good at that. Yeah. Did you have lessons when you were younger, or like...? No, I've... All self-taught? I've self... Well, pretty much, yeah. I've self-taught since I was 18. That's very impressive for self-taught then. Oh, man. Y-You all right?  Yeah. Uh, um...  So, yeah... Is it the first date where you said they played Skyrim for you on the piano? Yeah, it's the first time anyone's done that for me. So, thank you very much. Very accurate. But yeah, um...  All right. Well... Well, I had a good evening, Severin. Thank you for coming out here and doing this. Nice to get to know you. Yeah, nice to get to know you, too. Um... Yeah. So, uh, you know... Do, like...

It was nice meeting you. Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for coming out, and... Yep.  That's everything, so... Bye. Have a great night. You too, bye.  Yep. See ya, have a great one. She seems fairly geeky as well, which is, you know, my type. You know, I like someone who's a bit nerdy, like me. I think there may be potential there for something great.  Hey, Maddi. Hey, how are you guys?  Good! How was your date? Oh, yeah, really good. He was very... Severin was a very interesting guy.  Yeah? Cool! He played piano for... for me at the... at the restaurant. At the pub, so...   Oh, my Lord! Was he very good? Oh, he is really good. You know that game I play, Skyrim?  Yeah. He played me a music track on there which I recognize.

Yeah. They always insist on being part of my life, so...  As parents do, I suppose. Yeah.  What do you think's the biggest challenge you've had to overcome? Um...  Trying to work on my social skills, and... trying to... you know... see how the real world works, and stuff like that. It's been a huge challenge. Can't wait for today's activities. It's a good opportunity, too, darling. Oh, yes. in his search for love. Have a great day. Well, you too. Hope you learn a lot... I will. And get a lot out of today. See ya, Dad. See ya, mate. for people on the autism spectrum, One of the biggest misconceptions that I've found about people on the spectrum is that they're perfectly happy not being social, not dating, and that just really is very rarely true. You guys excited for today?  For years, my phone has just been ringing off the hook from adults and their family members, um, desperate to learn how to develop romantic relationships. So that's where we come in with our dating boot camps, is to try to teach the skills that many people sort of take for granted and use naturally in dating situations. Dating is a choice, right? Do we get to date everybody? No. No. Does everyone get to date us? No. What could be the problem with choosing someone who's maybe not so nice? They could be doing drugs or alcohol.  Yeah. They could be part of a gang or...  Yeah. Would that be a good choice in someone to date? No. So we're all clear, there's good choices and bad choices when it comes to dating, right? When we're on a date, we have to be able to make conversation with people. Remember, we're supposed to trade information. Well, there's lots of rules about trading information. So one of the things you do is you're gonna ask questions, right? Because what is the goal, what are you trying to find? Exactly. And so, in order to find common interests, you have to share things about yourself as well. Yes.  Okay, we're gonna see a few role-plays about what not to do. So I want you guys to watch this role-play, and I want you to notice what Nathan is doing wrong in trying to trade information. -So, Lizzie, what'd you do on the weekend? I just went to the beach. Oh, cool, which beach? Uh, Bronte. Oh, did you go with your friends? Yeah, a couple friends. Did you go swimming or surfing? Uh, swimming. Oh, do you build sandcastles?  Do you play beach volleyball?  All right, timeout. So what did Nathan do wrong, Joseph? Um, ask too many questions. He was being an interviewer, right? It's not a reciprocal conversation, so they're not finding common interests. It has to go back and forth. Okay, watch this next role-play. Think about what Nathan is doing wrong this time. So, Lizzie, who was the last person you dated?  Uh... Jason. Did you love him?  Uh... Yeah.  What about me? Do you love me? Uh, sorry. Could we order dinner first? When are we gonna go on our honeymoon?  I'm just not... Sorry.  When should we get married?  Okay, timeout. So what did Nathan do wrong? A little bit too personal. He was getting too personal. Yeah, what else? Mark? It was like this. He put the hammer down too soon, you know? Got right into it way too quickly. Yeah, right, kinda came on way too strong. Joseph? Was being a bit too imposing and getting down her throat a bit. Yeah, exactly. All right, guys. Well, now that we know how to trade information and hopefully make conversations during dates, we're gonna practice this. So, who wants to go first? Okay, Mark, wonderful. Come on up to the front of the room here with Lizzie. We're gonna imagine that you're on a date with Lizzie, and you're just making conversation.  Yeah. And what will your goal be in this conversation? To find common interests.  Very good. All right. So, what do you like to get up to on weekends? I kinda like playing tennis and things like that. Oh, yes. Swimming, yeah... Well, my mum plays tennis. Oh cool, nice. She used to be in the... the league, but... She doesn't anymore. You know, so she just does it in her spare time. Yeah. That sounds fun. Have you tried it? I have, but I'm a little bit sloppy at it. Keep missing it, it's just... I just... Um, just... Um, just trying to think... Sorry, I'm... Oh. So, don't worry about that. You're doing a fantastic job. But think about questions that you might ask the other person... Oh, yes. ...to sort of get out their interests. And then you're doing a good job of sharing about yourself, but always making sure you're also checking in with Lizzie. Question, do you ever find it difficult to sort of come up with new topics to talk about? Yes.  Yeah. Does... Does that happen to other people too?  Yeah. So, you know what? This is a great opportunity for all of us as a group to maybe brainstorm what are some common topics that people talk about on dates? Family, exactly. What else? Holidays?  Holidays!  A lot of people think that social skills are abstract, but in reality, we're all naturally following concrete rules and steps, and so it's really critical that we outline what these steps are for our young adults. What else do you like to do? Go hiking, or to the beach, or see my friends... What about you? Well... to go hiking as well. I love to get out in nature.  You do? Yeah, it's so much fun. It makes me feel peace whenever I'm in nature. Wouldn't you agree? Yeah. Yeah, I totally agree. Yeah. I got lost last time I went. Oh. Well, I know my way around the forest. Oh, that's good, yeah.  It's a very good skill to have. Yeah. Yeah. I think Mark did a great job. What do you guys think? I think he did awesome. Shall we give him a round of applause? Yes. Thank you.  That was fantastic.  Well done, Mark. Thank you, thanks. Thank you. Okay, well, it's just been such a pleasure working with all of you. I'm so, so, proud of all of the... the progress I just saw in one day. I just want to wish you all the best of luck in dating. You know, dating can be hard, for anybody. But now you guys have all the tools that you need, and it'll be a whole new experience for you moving forward. I wish you guys the very, very best of luck, and a big round of applause to all of you. Congratulations... ...on completing our boot camp. Can you feel those? Do you think they look cold enough? Perfect, yeah. for a date at the zoo.  What are your hopes for today? I hope we enjoy each other's company and we have a good time. Yeah. Just be your adorable, beautiful self. And... pay attention to what she's interested in. Tell here about yourself. I will. Sometimes girls like to talk about themselves, too... Yeah. ...a little bit. I know. I know. I've got one tip for you, Mark. You know how you've been going to the gym? You want her to see your muscles, so this is how you do it, just like... You go like this, and you go, ""Do you see the pelicans over there?"" And let her see it, okay? What do you think of that? She'll be impressed. What do you think of that tip? I know, I know. Just let me handle it my way. Yeah, thanks, Dad. Yes. Yeah, thanks.... Thanks. So happy for him. Ah, it'll be great, won't it? Bye, sweet."
