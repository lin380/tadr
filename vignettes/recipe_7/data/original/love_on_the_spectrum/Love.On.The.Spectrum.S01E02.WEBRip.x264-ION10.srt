1
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,200
[Michael] <i>I've never actually dated anyone</i>
<i>in the past.</i>

2
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,240
<i>I've been dreaming about marriage
for years, ever since I left school.</i>

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,920
<i>I do feel like I'm ready.</i>

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,160
[man] You all right?

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
Little nervous.

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,000
Just butterflies.

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,760
She won't see it there.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,600
- Hey!
- Hello, Amanda.

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,760
- [Amanda] How are you?
- Oh, please, allow me.

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,320
- Thank you.
- I'm...

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,440
- [Michael] How have you been?
- I'm good. How are you?

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,680
I'm very good as well.

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
And, um...

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
this is for you.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,800
Oh!

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,720
I love flowers.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,280
- You do?
- Yes.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,160
- Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,800
You know, I used to study flowers.

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,080
- I never knew that.
- Yeah. [laughs]

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
[Michael] Hmm.

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,720
So, um, what's been happening?

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,360
- Been working.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,920
Pretty sure. What have you been up to?

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,480
Not a lot, just work as well.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,400
Yeah.

27
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
[Michael] Mmm.

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Okay.

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,720
[Michael] Mmm.

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
Mmm.

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,840
The last time we met,
you said that you love cats, right?

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,360
And you also said...

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
- Ah, thank you.
- [waitress] It's all right.

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Thank you.

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,440
And, so what other hobbies do you have?

36
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,440
I've got birds I look after,

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,200
and I like to do a thing called cosplay
and go to conventions.

38
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
- Comic conventions?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,600
I do too!

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
- Really?
- Yep.

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,640
Yeah, have you been to one before?

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,080
Yes, the Oz Comic-Con.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,760
I've been at that one.
Have you been to any others?

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,080
No, just that.

45
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Yeah?

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
So, what else?

47
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,960
Hmm.

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Might have to come back to that one...

49
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
[Michael] Uh...

50
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,480
I wanted to ask you,
when is your birthday again?

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,640
I had it on Wednesday.

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,640
- Oh, I missed it.
- Yeah.

53
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
When's yours?

54
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Twentieth of March.

55
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,720
Same month as my cat's.

56
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Yeah.

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,880
So, how many birds do you have?

58
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,720
About 12...

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
I think.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,960
- I used to have more.
- [Michael] Oh.

61
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,560
So they flew away?

62
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,120
- Yep.
- Hmm.

63
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,600
That must have been saddening.

64
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,000
It's all right.

65
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,040
You just learn from it.

66
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,160
[inhales] I suppose.

67
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
[man] Would you like to take a break?

68
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,360
I'll be back, okay?

69
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,560
- Yeah, that's fine. That's fine.
- [Amanda] Oops.

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Yeah.

71
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,320
[inaudible]

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,200
[man] Is there anything we can do,
Amanda, to help you feel better?

73
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,880
[Amanda] I think it's too formal.

74
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,880
I can't do this.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,560
It's just bad anxiety.

76
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,280
Um, Cian?

77
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,560
- Cian?
- Hmm?

78
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,960
- Did I go too far?
- [Cian] Too far?

79
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,920
With... with the questions.

80
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,760
- [Cian] No, I don't think so. Not at all.
- Oh.

81
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
'Cause...

82
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,240
she seems a little bit quiet.

83
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
[Cian] Hmm.

84
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,400
- Um, here are your bag and your rose.
- Thank you.

85
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,440
[Michael] This doesn't have to be a date.

86
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,280
- Yeah.
- We can just, um...

87
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,560
have a friendly dinner as friends?

88
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
[Amanda] I think...

89
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,160
wait, and I'll do another time.

90
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Yeah.

91
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,840
Shall I s...

92
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,680
see you to the... door?

93
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,560
If you want to.

94
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,600
[Michael] Okay.

95
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,240
Well, it was lovely seeing you again,
Amanda.

96
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
[Amanda] Mm-hmm.

97
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
[Michael] Sorry how things turned out.

98
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
It's okay.

99
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,360
[Michael] I do feel bad.

100
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,880
Don't feel bad.

101
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,240
[Michael] I just feel like I may have gone
too far with the questions.

102
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
[Michael sighs]

103
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,560
[Michael inhales deeply, then sighs]

104
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,640
Well, you take care of yourself, Amanda.

105
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,400
- You too.
- [Michael] And good luck.

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Yeah.

107
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,120
[sighs]

108
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,400
Oh, well. [sighs]

109
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,440
That's... That's life, I guess.

110
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Hi, I'm Maddi.

111
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,320
I'm single, and I'm on the spectrum.

112
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,800
I enjoy video games, books, and animals.

113
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,200
[Cian] How would you describe yourself,
Maddi?

114
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,360
I'm a very independent person.

115
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,080
Reasonably smart.

116
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,520
Uh, quirky.

117
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,840
[chuckles]

118
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,480
Always seem to, like, stand out
a little bit without even trying.

119
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,680
Or I'm funny without trying,
people tell me, so... [chuckles]

120
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,440
[Cian] What's something
you'd like people to know about you?

121
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,200
That just because I'm on the spectrum,
I'm not... I'm not...

122
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,160
I'm not dumb.

123
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,120
Some people can be
really condescending, like,

124
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,840
"How... are... you?" sort of thing.

125
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,040
I'm like, please, come on. [chuckles]

126
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,960
[Cian] How do you know
when you're in love?

127
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,480
Um, I can't really say for sure,
'cause I've never really been in love,

128
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,680
but I can only go by what...

129
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,760
like, what I've seen in movies and things,
so I'm not really...

130
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Can't get into that too well, sorry.
[laughs]

131
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,400
[Cian] Can you describe
your ideal partner?

132
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,720
Tall, muscular...

133
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,600
rich. [chuckles]

134
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,360
[birds chirping]

135
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
So, what do you guys think
about me dating?

136
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,760
I think it's great if you wanna date.

137
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,240
Maybe you should date, get married,
and move out of home.

138
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,680
- Move out of home being the important one.
- Ah...

139
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,600
Well, how would you react
if I brought a boy home?

140
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,960
I think we'd cheer.

141
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,360
I'd have to vet him.

142
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,040
Make sure he was suitable for you.

143
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,000
Make him very uncomfortable.

144
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,520
Like we did with Montana,

145
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,416
- when she brought her boyfriend home.
- Right.

146
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
What do you think?

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,776
If I ever date, it'll be a couple of years
before he meets you guys, at least.

148
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,640
- Years?!
- [laughs] That's a bit rude.

149
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,520
Protect the poor guy for a little while,
for God's sake.

150
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,400
- Oh!
- Okay, well what about tonight?

151
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,056
- Let's talk about tonight.
- Who's going?

152
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,000
So, superheroes disco tonight,
down at Darling Harbour.

153
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,760
- And what are you going as tonight?
- Look for a Superman girl.

154
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,120
- [mother] Batgirl?
- Yes.

155
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,240
Maybe we look for a Batman tonight.

156
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,160
Okay, we're focusing a bit too much
on tonight.

157
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,160
Well, I think you gotta start somewhere,
and maybe we start with tonight.

158
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,160
What do you think are the qualities
of a man that you'd like to date?

159
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,720
Rich, muscular, tall.

160
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,680
- [scoffs]
- Eight-pack.

161
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,960
Like your mother landed.

162
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,440
[mother] Rich, muscular, tall. Mm-hmm.

163
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,320
You need to lower your standards.

164
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,200
[laughing] You're not gonna get tall,
muscular, eight-pack.

165
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,656
- You don't go to the gym.
- Where'd this eight-pack come from?

166
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,520
It looks good.

167
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,736
- You don't go to the gym!
- I don't want someone flabby.

168
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,600
Excuse you! You don't either.

169
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,736
- We were supposed to go to the gym today.
- I did go.

170
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,960
There's no shame in being picky
when it comes to love.

171
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,560
- [laughter]
- [Maddi] What?

172
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,856
- [Maddi] Have I got this on backwards?
- [mother] Yep.

173
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,280
These ones go down over your shoe.

174
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,216
- So, at the back, like...
- No, at the front, so turn it round.

175
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,760
[narrator] <i>Maddi's mum Terri</i>
<i>is her greatest support.</i>

176
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,240

[Terri] Okay, pull it up.

180
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
Yep.

181
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,080
I would like to see her
have somebody in her life.

182
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,760
Clearly, I'm not gonna be here forever.

183
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,320
It would give me some comfort

184
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,240
to think that someone's there
to look after her

185
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,160
and she's there
to look after somebody else.

186
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,120
There we go. Wow, that looks cool.

187
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,880
Where's the mask?
Did you put it somewhere?

188
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,280
- No, I've got the mask here.
- Thank you.

189
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,560
[Cian] Do you ever worry
that she will end up alone?

190
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Yeah, all the time.

191
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,240
Mmm. All the time.

I'm trying to think.

Yes.

- Looking good?
<i>- </i>Good. Good.

244
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
[Cian] Excellent.

245
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,080
So, you're ready to start?

246
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,560
I'm Kelvin. I'm 21.

247
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,760
I have autism,

248
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,080
a disability which helps me
concentrate on one thing,

249
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,680
rather than getting distracted by others.

250
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,240
[Cian] So, you think your autism
helps you to really focus on one thing.

251
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,640
How old were you when you were diagnosed
with autism, Kelvin?

252
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,800
Two years old.

253
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,120
[Cian] Wow, that's pretty young, hey.

254
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,040
Do you think you're different
to other people your age?

255
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Yes.

256
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,960
[Cian] How are you different?

257
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,080
I have a different, uh, look in my face,

258
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,720
and different personality from others.

259
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,640
[Cian] How would you describe yourself?

260
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,600
I'm caring, smart,

261
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,760
gentle, considerate,

262
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
and professional.

Yes, definitely, yes.

272
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,320
Being his father, yeah.

273
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,120
Yeah, I'd really like to see
if he can... [inhales]

274
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,600
uh, have... have a date,

275
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,640
and then girlfriend, have a partner,

276
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,240
and then, even better, to have a family.

277
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,360
That's nice, isn't it?

278
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,680
A bit hard, but, uh, hopefully, uh,

279
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,360
there will be a day
that, uh, this is possible.

280
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,600
[Cian] What's the hard part?
What do you think will be difficult?

281
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,760
I think it's the, like... [exhales]

282
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,920
uh, for him to communicate with somebody
which is at the same wavelength.

283
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,840
[Cian] How did you feel when you heard

284
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,520
- that he was on the spectrum?
- Uh, devastating,

285
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,880
but, uh, well, we have to come to terms,

286
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,760
and we have to try our best,
like, to help him.

287
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,200
Yeah, that's what we did,
like, all these years.

288
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,720
[Cian] Are you proud of him?

289
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
Oh, definitely.

290
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,680
I'm very proud of my son, yeah.

291
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,320
Hopefully, one day, he will...
He will find his partner.Yeah.

292
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,920
[Cian] Good to at least start
with maybe a bit of practice.

293
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,680
- Hmm, yeah.
- Practicing what?

294
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,720
- Dad?
- Hmm?

295
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Practicing what?

296
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,280
Uh, go out dating
and seeing other, uh, people,

297
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,040
and seeing ladies...

298
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,200
Taking them out for dating, on dates?

299
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,560
Yep, have dinner, go to the movies, yeah.

300
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,000
Someone who is younger than you, Dad.

301
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,680
Yes, of course, yes.

302
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,560
For your dating, yes.

303
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
[Cian] What do you think love feels like?

304
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,840
Love feels like when a man
and woman get together,

305
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,320
they'll make a perfect bond.

306
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,320
[Cian] Do you think it's harder
for people with autism to find...

307
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,160
a relationship, to find a partner?

308
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,360
Some of them.

309
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,080
Some girls don't feel like dating
with someone in disa... with disabilities.

What is it, Dad?

313
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,800
[Cian] It's me, Cian.

314
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Can we come in?

315
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
[Kelvin] Um, yes.

321
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440

She likes jellybeans, miso soup,
mackerel,

332
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,720
and carbonated drinks.

333
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,000
- [Cian] So you made up that character?
- Yes. It's for my story.

334
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,600
- [Cian] Where is your story?
- [Kelvin] It's...

335
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,160
[Cian] Wow, that is incredible.

336
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,760
You wrote all this?

337
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,080
[Kelvin] Yeah, I wrote it from my mind.

338
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,480
I'll still keep on writing
until I reach the end of this book.

339
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,120
- [Cian] I think that'll take you a while.
- [Kelvin] What...?

340
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,560
Oh.

341
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,960
T-That's enough. Excuse me.

342
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,440
- That's enough for now, okay?
- [Cian] Enough filming?

343
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,280
- Yes. Thank you.

- [Michael] Hello, Jodi.

351
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,880
How are things?

352
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,680
<i>- Very well, how are things with you?</i>
- Things have been pretty good.

353
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Just work and that's about it.

[Jodi] <i>Last time I was down there,</i>

355
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,640
<i>you were about to go out on a date
with somebody.</i>

356
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,840
About the date, it ended too early.

357
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,760
<i>Oh!</i>

358
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,720
My date got overwhelmed by the atmosphere.

359
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,080
She had anxiety,

360
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,920
and I was starting to get a bad vibe
about things.

361
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,040
I just told her that if she had to go,

362
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,040
she was quite welcome to.

363
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,080
That's really supportive.

364
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,680
<i>Till she had to leave,</i>

365
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,120
<i>did you feel like
you were getting to know her?</i>

366
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,360
[Michael] Yeah, I was.

367
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,480
[Jodi] <i>Yeah? What things</i>
<i>did you have in common?</i>

368
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,680
We both love cats.

369
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,720
She loves comic conventions,
and I do as well.

370
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,680
<i>Would you like to see her again?</i>

371
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,920
I'm actually gonna be seeing her
on Sunday.

372
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,440
<i>Well that's pretty good.</i>

373
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,680
We'll be going
to a comic convention together.

374
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,000
[Jodi] <i>Well that's excellent.</i>

375
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,640
<i>Do you think that the two of you</i>

376
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,080
<i>might find more things in common
with each other?</i>

377
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,960
Who knows? We might.

378
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,920
<i>It's very hard when the first time
you feel a little bit awkward</i>

379

<i>- and things don't go well.</i>
- Yeah.

380
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,360
<i>But this could be fantastic
on the weekend.</i>

381
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,200
<i>So, are you gonna wear a costume?</i>

382
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,960
Yes, the Skipper off <i>Gilligan's Island.</i>

383
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,720
[laughs]

384
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,640
<i>- That's a great costume!</i>
- Because... Because Dawn Wells,

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,400
who played Mary Ann on the show,

386
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,880
will be there herself.

387
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,600
<i>Oh, that's pretty exciting.</i>

388
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,400
She's pretty much the total package.

389
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,576
- [laughs]
- She's not the hottest woman in the world,

390
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,480
she's beautiful,
but not extremely beautiful,

391
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,280
but she's definitely polite,

392
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,040
she's pure and very wholesome.

393
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,600
That kind of woman is very hard to find.

394
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,240
- Which is unfortunate.
<i>- Okay.</i>

395
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,320
[Jodi] <i>So, if you had a girlfriend,</i>
<i>you'd want her to be more like Mary Ann.</i>

396
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Yes.

397
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,560
<i>- I think that sounds like a good plan.</i>
- Yeah.

398
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,520
[Jodi] <i>All right, well, just have fun.</i>

399
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,440
<i>- Just have lots and lots of fun on Sunday.</i>
- [Michael] Yep. Will do.

400
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,800
- [Jodi] <i>It was lovely to speak to you.</i>
- Likewise. Thank you for your time.

401
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960

- All right, see ya. Take care of yourself.

[video call disconnects]

403
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,160
[Cian] Would you say that you're different
to other people?

404
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,040
Well, yeah, 'cause I've got a disability,
I'm on the spectrum,

405
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,376
people are always gonna look at me
as different from them,

406
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,681
and I know I'm different from them,
and that's fine, so...

407
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,240
If we're all the same,
the world would be pretty boring. [laughs]

408
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,560
[Cian] Would you like to go out with a guy
who is also on the spectrum?

409
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Yes.

410
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,760
[exhales] Some people like to choose

411
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,960
partners who are the exact opposites
of them.

412
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,216
They've run out of things to talk about.
How is that so?

413
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,160
If you have lots in common,
you wouldn't run out,

414
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,560
it'd be endless conversations.

415
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
So, I think...

416
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,800
similar personality traits is quite good.

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,040
Palen... What is it?

520
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,360
- Pa-leon-to-lo-gy.
- Pa-leon...

521
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's all right, it's okay.

522
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,120
Paleontology, okay.

523
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
[Mark] Yeah.

524
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,680
[laughing]

525
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,360
How's yours?

526
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,080
It was nice, it was really nice.

527
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,000
- I love ravi... ravioli.
- [Maddi] Mmm.

528
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,680
You look beautiful.

529
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,760
Very, very beautiful.

530
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,800
Thank you, you look...
you look quite nice your... yourself.

531
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,960
Thank you.

532
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,080
And that's a really beautiful necklace.
You're very lucky to have that.

533
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,000
[Maddi chuckles]

534
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,280
It suits you well.

535
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,400
[Maddi chuckles]

536
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,800
Thank you. Thank you.

537
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,640
I just wish this night didn't have to end.

538
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
[both laugh]

539
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,120
I can't remember
when I've had this much fun.

540
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,480
Yeah! It's been... certainly been...

541
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,760
certainly been
a very interesting evening, so...

542
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,040
[Mark laughs]

543
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
Well...

544
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
[Maddi] Thank you.

545
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,520
Thank you. Um...

546
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,000
[Mark mumbling]

547
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Maybe we should dine and dash,
what do you reckon?

548
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,920
- [laughing] Oh, no!
- [Maddi laughs]

549
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
No? You don't... don't like that idea?

550
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,200
Subtotal...

551
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,160
We could grab our stuff
and run down the street.

552
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,720
What... What... What did you order?

553
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,160
The gnocchi.

554
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,920
Shall we pay for ours separately
or something?

555
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Uh...

556
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,280
I've... I've got money, so, like...

557
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,600
Would you like to split?

558
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
How would you like it?

559
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,080
Actually, um, I'll pay on this.

560
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
[waitress] Yeah.

561
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,600
Rest on the card?

562
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,040
[Maddi] Yes. Okay.

563
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,600
Well, it's nice to meet you.

564
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,520
It was nice to meet you, Mark.
Thank you for...

565
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,640
I hope we meet each other again.
I had a great time,

566
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,040
and I hope we can do this again.

567
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,360
I had a good time too.
It would be good to hang out...

568
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,640
- Yes.
- ...again, like...

569
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,000
And I wish you all the best.

570
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,376
- Thank you.
- Thanks, once again.

571
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,280
Thank you.

572
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,400
- See you. Have a wonderful night.
- Bye, Mark. Thank you very much for...

573
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
You're welcome.

574
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,600
- ...the flowers.
- Thanks.

575
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,640
- You have a good night.
- You too.

576
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,480
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

577
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
[Maddi] See ya.

578
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,400
[Cian] How did the date go, Mark?
Do you like Maddi?

579
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,680
Oh, she's really nice and very sweet,

580
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
and charming.

581
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,240
I feel like she's the type of person

582
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,520
that I'd love to spe...

583
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,520
have spend my life with.

584
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,760
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Mum.

585
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
How'd you go?

586
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,376
- Great.
- Did you have a lovely time?

587
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Oh, loved it.

588
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
- Lovely meal, and enjoyed the company?
- Oh, yes.

589
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,920
- Oh, she was spectacular.
- Beautiful?

590
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,280
Oh, that's lovely, darling.

591
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
She was a lovely woman.

592
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,640
Yeah? That's awesome.

593
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,160
Never had that much fun in one night.

594
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,160
Can't remember the last time
I ever felt this good.

595
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
Oh, really? I'm so happy for you.

596
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,520
[Cian] So, how was tonight, Maddi?

597
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,760
Yeah, it was a good night.
I had fun. We had lots to talk about.

598
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,160
- He seems pretty smart, so, yeah.
- [Cian] Yeah?

599
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,400
Yeah, not many people interested in...

600
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,176
paleontology. I think I've got that right.
Hope that was right.

601
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,360
Add the eight-pack,
and that'll be perfection, so... [laughs]

602
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,440
[Cian] Do you think
you're a romantic person?

603
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,640
I will be.

604
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
[Cian] How would you ask a girl on a date?

605
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,000
If you liked someone,
how would you ask them?

606
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,200
Shall we go out for dinner together?

607
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,240
Or should we have some...

608
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,120
Shall we go out for a party...

609
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,320
and dance to the music together?

610
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
It'll be fun.

611
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
[birds chirping]

612
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,960
[narrator] <i>As well as helping Michael,</i>

613
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,360
<i>relationship specialist Jodi Rodgers
has come to meet Kelvin</i>

614
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,680
<i>to work on his dating skills.</i>

615
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
[knocking]

616
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,440
Often when I meet people
for the first time,

617
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm really checking to see
what their ability is

618
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,240
with initiating conversation.

619
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,160
Sometimes I won't say hello to start with.

620
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,360
I'll wait and see whether they can
actually initiate verbally.

621
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,520
Because sometimes
people can't start a social interaction.

622
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
[speaking indistinctly in sing-song voice]

623
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,760
Cool, it's you. Jodi?

624
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,960
- Hello.
- Hey there.

625
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,000
- Welcome.
- [Jodi] Thank you.

626
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,680
Nice to meet you.

627
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,520
- My name's Kelvin.
- Nice to meet you, Kelvin.

628
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,280
It's called the autism spectrum,

629
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,760
because it's a spectrum.

630
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,440
Come on, follow me.

631
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,240
[Jodi] There is not two people
on the spectrum

632
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,840
where their autism presents
in the same way.

633
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,080
It is <i>so </i>diverse.

634
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,440
And that's its beauty.

635
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,000
It doesn't matter
whether you're on the spectrum or not,

636
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,320
everybody has a basic human right

637
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,320
and a basic human need
for connection and love.

638
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
So...

639
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,000
here's the girl.

640
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,160
Why do you want to have this girlfriend?

641
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,800
Because we... Because she's nice.

642
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,240
[Jodi] What will you and the girlfriend
do together?

643
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,120
Together... we should go out on... a date.

644
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,040
[Jodi] Yeah?

645
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,400
What else do girlfriends
and boyfriends do?

646
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,440
Hug and kisses?

647
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,280
[Kelvin] Hugs and... yeah.

648
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,920
Hugs and kisses.

649
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,360
So, would you like to do hugs and kisses?

650
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,280
Yes.

651
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
[Jodi] Yes.

652
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,160
When we go on our first date
with somebody,

653
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,160
what do we do on date number one?

654
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,000
We should introduce her by name...

655
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,360
first.

656
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,960
What if the girl
wants to sit down at the table?

657
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,720
What would you...
would be a good thing for you to do?

658
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,120
- Good thing...
- Like this, so you and I,

659
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,880
I'm... I'm... I'm gonna come...
Pretend Dad's not there,

660
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,680
'cause we don't want Dad
on the date, do we?

661
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
- What?
- [David laughs]

662
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,960
[Jodi] No way,
Dad's not coming on the date.

663
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,520
You show me what a gentleman
would do if... if...

664
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,640
Jodi's coming on... to meet you.

665
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,320
- Okay, you ready?
- Are you a gentleman?

666
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
[Kelvin] Hi.

667
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,920
Here you go. Here's your seat.

668
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
[chuckles] First of all,
you have to introduce...

669
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,640
Hi, my name's Kelvin Wong.

670
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,160
Nice to meet you.

671
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,400
My... My interests are manga and drawing
and computer.

672
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,280
Okay, first of all,
you want Jodi to sit down,

673
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,840
so we're on the same level.

674
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,400
- Don't we?
- [Kelvin] Yes.

675
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,040
Okay, so here's my chair here. Try again.

676
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,880
- [Kelvin] Okay.
- Okay, you ready?

677
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Here I come...

678
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,480
- Hi, Jodi, my name is Kelvin Wong.
- [laughter]

679
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,680
Nice to meet you.

680
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,600
Hello, Kelvin. My name's Jodi.

681
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,360
- Then the chair. Let her sit down.
- Uh... Here's your chair.

682
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,760
No, go out and take the chair,
and then...

683
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
- Go out and take...
- No.

684
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,480
No, Kelvin. Stand up, get the chair out,
and let the lady sit down.

685
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,960
And then you say, here's your...

686
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,080
- Here's your chair, Jodi.
- Thank you very much.

687
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,680
- No, now you have to...
- [laughs]

688
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,960
That's a good...

689
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,360
When... When the girl...

690
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,080
She might already be sitting,
but remember,

691
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,360
before you move
onto talking about yourself,

692
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,160
we always do greetings first.

693
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,120
Greeting. Greeting.

694
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,760
Now, how... how are we going
to start talking with the girl about...

695
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,320
common interest?

696
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Common...

697
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,720
Common inter...

698
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,120
If you just start talking about...

699
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,320
"Hi, I'm really into computers,
and I really like games and my iPad."

700
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
- No!
- Okay.

701
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,400
So the girls really like it...

702
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,240
if people, boys,

703
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,920
the first thing they do is ask them...

704
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,920
- [Kelvin] A question.
- Perfect.

705
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,560
Because then the girl thinks...

706
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,640
[gasps]

707
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,800
"Kelvin is really interested in me."

708
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,760
What would be a good first question
that you could ask her?

709
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,640
Ask her... What are your interests?

710
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,200
Oh, nice one.

711
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,160
- What are your interests...
- Perfect!

712
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,160
...by the way.

713
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,120
Perfect.

714
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,720
So what about if she comes back
and she says,

715
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,440
"I love animals
and everything about animals."

716
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,760
- [Kelvin] Ooh.
- [David laughs]

717
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,320
Cutie, indeed.

718
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,800
And they are so cute like toys.

719
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,520
They are like toys. What about...

720
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,160
And then the girl might ask you
a question...

721
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,680
Do you like animals?

722
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,600
I meant, I'm also interested in animals.

723
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,720
We should go to the koala park.

724
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,680
[laughs]

725
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,920
You're fine... Well, that was nice.

726
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,320
Why were you suggesting
that you go to the koala park?

727
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,640
It's because she likes animals.

728
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,280
I'm really proud. That is excellent.

729
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,880
If she likes something
that you don't like, is that okay?

730
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,200
So, say she says,

731
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,880
"Oh, my favorite anime is...

732
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,880
<i>Sailor Moon."</i>

733
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,240
[Kelvin] Yeah, uh, I used to...

734
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,640
What if she goes, "I like..."

735
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,920
[Kelvin] I used to watch it,

736
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,120
but not anymore.

737
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Not anymore.

738
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,040
So is that okay that she likes
different anime and manga than you?

739
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,960
[Kelvin] Yes, like,

740
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,640
I get that <i>Ouran High School</i>
is bad taste, and I shouldn't watch it,

741
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,760
because of... 'cause it has mature themes.

742
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,480
Okay. So, we started talking about anime.

743
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,200
What did you do with your body?

744
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,280
Uh...

745
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,200
Looking away.

746
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,320
You're looking away.

747
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,560
- And that's a no.
- [Jodi and David laugh]

748
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Exactly.

749
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,800
We've gotta keep the conversation being...

750
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Fifty-fifty.

751
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,200
[Jodi] Fifty-fifty.

752
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,280
So, if you turn away and start talking
to yourself about your manga...

753
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,000
It's not a good thing.

754
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,680
It's not fifty-fifty, is it?

755
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,640
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- [Jodi and David laugh]

756
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
I'll be back.

757
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,080
It's good that you come in
and, like, show him all this.

758
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,720
Like, it's very, very useful for him.

759
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,240
Sometimes, like, man to man,

760
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,920
- it's difficult to get over to him.
- It's very hard.

761
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,120
Do you know, I think this is stuff that...

762
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,680
This is all the...
the really simple things...

763
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,920
- [David] Mmm.
- Um,

764
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,560
that we forget are so important
about social skills.

765
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,240
- Mmm-hmm, yes.
- But when you get to 21,

766
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,840
almost 22,

767
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,760
and he's desiring to have a relationship,

768
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,640
it's very hard for a dad to do that.

769
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
- Yeah, yeah.
- Isn't it?

770
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,560
- I find it really hard for me to...
- Yeah.

771
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,760
My job just is teaching people

772
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,240
- who are ready for...
- Um...

773
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,920
- ...dating and relationships.
- Yeah.

774
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,680
- And...
- Uh, for next one,

775
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,840
I'll ask her what movie we're watching.

776
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,600
Oh, have you been thinking about that?

777
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,000
Oh, I... I was thinking.

778
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,680
So, the most important thing
about the first date is...

779
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,320
Is the...

780
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,240
Is, um...

781
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,880
Greet her!

782
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,800
Greet her.

783
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,480
And what are you trying to find out?

784
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,200
You're trying to find out...

785
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,960
what you have in...

786
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,600
What?

787
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,160
- In common.
- Perfect.

788
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,600
You have to have some things
that are the same...

789
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,400
but you're allowed to have
some things that are...

790
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,000
- Different.
- Perfect.

791
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,200
I think your dating's gonna be good.

792
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,040
Just remember, we go up the steps...

793
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,800
slowly.

794
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,160
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy.

795
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,680
I think for Kelvin, the challenge
is just gonna be the beginning.

796
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,520
Challenges of social skills
with another person.

797
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
He's at the really beginning journey

798
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,320
of understanding what it is
to be with another person

799
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,840
and what that feels like,

800
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,280
and has to go through all the things
that we all go through.

801
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,440
The rejection,

802
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,480
finding out whether we've got
a good match with somebody...

803
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,880
At this stage in his learning,

804
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,200
it's... it's about practicing.

805
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,160
Just getting out there
and giving it a go,

806
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,720
and finding out
who's a good match for him.

807
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,320
Out you go, Jodi.

808
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,120
I'll see you anytime.

809
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,280
- Okay, see you, Kelvin!
- [Kelvin] See you!

810
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,520
[birds chirping]

811
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,480
- [Terri] Hey, bud.
- Hey.

812
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,600
How'd it go?! How'd it go?!

813
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,080
Tell me all about it!

814
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,320
Calm down. [chuckles]

815
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,760
How did it go?

816
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,560
Yeah, fine. He was a very nice guy.

817
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,160
Really? What did he look like?

818
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,080
- Oh, you've got a photo?
- Yes, I do.

819
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,160
Perfect!

820
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,280
Oh, he's very nice.

821
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,840
Yeah. Yeah...

822
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,280
Are they the flowers that he brought you?

823
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,200
[Maddi] Yeah.

824
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,640
- That was a nice touch, white roses.
- Yes, yes.

825
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,280
What did you do when you got the roses?

826
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,960
- I said thank you and hugged him.
- You hugged him?!

827
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
- Yeah, like...
- Show me. Show me what you did.

828
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,320
Just like that, sort of thing.

829
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,240
- Oh!
- I can do it properly standing up.

830
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,760
Oh, that's a good thing.

831
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,480
Don't make a fuss, honestly.

832
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,280
No, everything was okay?
All right, tell me all about him.

833
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,560
What do you mean?

834
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,240
Well, do you want to see him again?

835
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,160
- Yes.
- Perfect.

836
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,000
I think he looks
like he's good son-in-law material.

837
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,400
- Off you go, thanks. Off you go. Goodbye.
- [laughing]

838
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,040
[Terri] Okay, all right. [chuckles]

839
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,120
Parents, honestly... [sighs]

840
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,480
Jeez, Louise.

841
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,376
[Cian] Do you feel like you've got
a lot of love to give?

842
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,240
Yes.

843
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,000
All the people I know and care about,

844
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,280
they know me for my...

845
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,000
for my large heart,

846
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,040
which was once described as...

847
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,480
ten sizes too large.

848
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,200
[people chattering]

849
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
[camera shutter clicks]

850
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,440
Aha! There she is.

851
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,400
- Hello, Amanda.
- Hey!

852
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,560
Good to see you again.

853
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,760
Good to see you.

854
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,240
What are you dressed up as?

855
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,040
My character name's Riko.

856
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
From what?

857
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,640
An anime called <i>Love Live!</i>

858
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,800
- Ah.
- [Amanda] Yeah.

859
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,680
- Right.
- What's the book you've got?

860
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,080
Oh, that's a cookbook.

861
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,680
- Is that part of your character?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

862
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,840
- Oh.
- Actually, um...

863
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,240
I wanted to see if I could get Dawn Wells
to, um, autograph this.

864
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,720
- Okay.
- [Michael clears throat]

865
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,360
Is there anywhere you wanna go?

866
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,080
Uh, yes. Um, you want to check out
a few places?

867
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Okay.

868
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,000
Do you know much about Dawn Wells?

869
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
No...

870
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,960
- Barbara Eden?
- No.

871
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,640
- Barbara Feldon?
- [laughing] No.

872
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Oh.

873
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,920
Then you probably haven't seen
<i>Gilligan's Island.</i>

874
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,360
- No.
- Or <i>Get Smart.</i>

875
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,280
- No...
<i>- </i>Or <i>I Dream Of Jeannie?</i>

876
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,560
- Mmm-mmm.
- Ah.

877
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,960
Oh, look, there's one
with a costume right now!

878
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,976
- [Amanda] The genie? Yeah!
- [Michael] Look! Look!

879
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,360
- [Amanda] I can see.
- That's her!

880
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,040
- Yep. [laughs]
- That's the costume.

881
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,400
If you ever wanted to have lunch
or dinner somewhere,

882
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,000
we don't have to...
have to go somewhere formal.

883
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,640
- Okay.
- We can go somewhere casual.

884
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,560
Yeah.

885
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,760
[Michael] Probably should've done that
the first time.

886
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,600
So, what do you wanna look at first?

887
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,880
There is something I want to get.

888
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,320
It's up this way.

889
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,600
[man speaking indistinctly]

890
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

891
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Oh, no.

892
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,400
[Amanda] Everything okay?

893
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,240
- Don't you agree that that mask is creepy?
- Where?

894
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,040
Right there, the guy with the dark hair.

895
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,040
I refuse to watch those <i>Halloween </i>films.

896
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,680
- You don't like them?
- I hate 'em.

897
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,120
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

898
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,480
- Yeah.
- They're too scary.

899
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,080
[horror theme plays]

900
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,360
A little bird tells me
that you love plushes.

901
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,040
I do. I've got lots of them.

902
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,440
- Yeah?
- Yep.

903
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,720
I actually have a bit of an affinity
for them myself.

904
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,120
You like them too?

905
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,640
I keep it secret, though.

906
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,960
Oh. [laughs]

907
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,560
It's because they're...
They're not exactly something for men.

908
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,280
How are you feeling, by the way?

909
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,360
I'm okay.

910
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,720
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

911
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,720
Not feeling anxious in any way?

912
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,400
I want you to feel comfortable.
That's all I care about right now.

913
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,920
You recognize something?

914
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,360
Does look like you.

915
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,560
[laughs]

916
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,160
- [Michael] Should we buy this one?
- Yes.

917
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,600
Okay, then I'll get it for you.

918
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,280
- [Amanda] Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

919
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,360
I'll just grab that, thank you.

920
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,760
Thank you.

921
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,640
- There you are, Amanda.
- Thank you.

922
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,720
It's my pleasure.

923
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,200
It's a little gift from me to you.

924
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,040
Well, I...
I'll be heading off to, um, my...

925
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,920
that autograph and photograph thing.

926
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,200
- Yep.
- So, right now, um...

927
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,200
I have to say, it was really lovely
spending time with you again.

928
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,640
It was good to see you too.

929
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,560
Thanks.

930
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,240
Are you interested in, um, spending time
together again sometime soon?

931
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,560
I'll think about it.

932
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,160
Okay, you just have the time
to think it over.

933
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,400
- And, um, take care.
- See you later.

934
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
And good luck.

935
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,000
[Michael] She's still a great person
to spend time with.

936
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,840
We're... We're friends, probably.

937
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,200
Dating? Probably not.

938
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,480
[narrator] <i>Michael's day</i>
<i>isn't over just yet.</i>

939
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,040
<i>He's about to meet his perfect woman.</i>

940
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,360
There she is, right over there.
Right over there.

941
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
Oh, dear.

942
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,760
I can't believe this is happening!

943
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,600
- [Cian] You okay?
- Yep.

944
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,800
I can't remember the last time
I felt this excited.

945
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Oh, dear.

946
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,200
It's finally happening!

947
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,200
[Dawn] There's the Skipper.
I've seen you all day.

948
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,120
[man] Hey, hello.

949
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,280
Dawn Wells!

950
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,400
- George Smith. What's your name?
- Michael Theo.

951
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,896
- Hello, Michael.
- It is... It is...

952
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,160
I can't tell you what an honor this is.

953
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,000
Since you were a little boy.

954
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,920
- Yep.
- Yeah.

955
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,800
- Yep. Since...
- Where'd you grow up?

956
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,760
- Wollongong.
- Where's that?

957
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,640
- That's on the south coast.
- Yes.

958
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,016
- Yep.
- You'd make a good Skipper!

959
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,280
- Thanks!
- Can I hug you?

960
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,776
- Yeah, sure, absolutely!
- Where's our camera? Right over here.

961
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,560
[gasps] Here's the Skipper!

962
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,440
- Have a good life, dear.
- You too, Dawn Wells.

963
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,960
- Thank you, dear.
- And also... God bless you.

964
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,920
God bless you too.

965
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

966
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,560
[Michael] That's one of the most
cherished moments I've ever had in life.

967
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,240
It was quite a privilege.

968
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,160
Really loved it.

969
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,720
[Cian] Do you have anything else
you want to say?

970
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Oh, yes.

971
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,400
One thing that I'd like to...

972
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,840
One message that I'd like to send
to all women in the world.

973
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,560
I would be the kind of partner
that is able to provide

974
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,720
five things that every woman needs.

975
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,560
Love, respect, happiness, support,
and security.

976
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,480
[cell phone ringing]

977
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,680
- [Terri] Oops.
- [father] Uh-oh. Here's trouble.

978
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,120
- Oh, my goodness, who's that?
- Who's that?

979
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
Hello?

980
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,280
[Mark] <i>Hello, it's... This is Mark.</i>

981
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,840
- Hi, Mark, how are you? It's Maddi.
- [Mark] <i>I'm...</i>

982
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,600
<i>How... I'm good. How are you, Maddi?</i>

983
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,960
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.

984
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,976
- [whispering]
- [Mark] <i>Oh, that's.. that's great.</i>

985
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,760
- We've...
- [Mark] <i>That's wonderful to hear.</i>

986
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,480
I've recently adopted a new puppy.

987
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,280
- [Mark] <i>Awesome! That's great.</i>
- [Maddi] Yeah.

988
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,016
- He's a...
- [Mark] <i>What kind...</i>

989
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,520
He's a miniature schnauzer
and his name is Arnold.

990
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
- [Mark] <i>Arnold.</i>
- Yeah.

991
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,240
<i>Oh, lovely, lovely.</i>

992
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,200
[Mark chuckles]

993
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,496
<i>- That's wonderful to hear.</i>
- Ask him what he's been doing.

994
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,000
[Mark] <i>Great, you've got a companion.</i>

995
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,600
Yes, a new best friend.

996
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,080
- Ask him...
- [Mark] <i>Yeah.</i>

997
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,920
<i>Also, I've been ringing you up because</i>

998
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,840
<i>I was just thinking, would you like to go
on a second date to Sydney next Friday?</i>

999
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,456
- [whispers] Next Friday.
- Yes, that would be...

1000
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,640
Yes, I would like... I would like to do
another catch-up. That'd be interesting.

1001
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,200
[Mark] <i>Yes.</i>

1002
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,576
- [whispers] Where?
- [Mark] <i>And I was thinking maybe I could</i>

1003
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,480
<i>take you to the Australian Museum, and...</i>

1004
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,520
<i>we can go for a walk through Hyde Park.</i>

1005
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,296
Yeah, that sounds like...
That sounds like it'll be good.

1006
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,120
[Mark] <i>Yeah, or whatever, you know.</i>

1007
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,080
- Yeah.
- You need to...

1008
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,960
[Mark] <i>Because I had such a great time</i>
<i>the last time.</i>

1009
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,320
<i>It was really wonderful,</i>

1010
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,440
<i>and I would love to do something
like that again.</i>

1011
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,720
Yeah, it was... it was nice, wasn't it?
It was pleasant.

1012
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,640
Will he remember? Ask him.

1013
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
Oh, well, you'll...

1014
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,440
You'll probably remember what I look like
after one date, I think?

1015
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,400
[Mark] <i>Of course I will.</i>

1016
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
Great.

1017
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,600
[Mark] <i>Yes, I mean...</i>

1018
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,600
<i>I can never forget a beautiful face.</i>

1019
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,560
Thank you, that's very kind to say.

1020
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,080
- [father] Nice work.
- [Mark] <i>It's okay. It's...</i>

1021
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,640
<i>- It's a pleasure.</i>
- [chuckles]

1022
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,560
<i>That's okay.</i>

1023
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,640
[Mark laughs]

1024
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,480
<i>Anyway, thanks for your time, Maddi.</i>

1025
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,120
<i>And I look forward to seeing you again.</i>

1026
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,760
No problem, I'll... I'll see you later.

1027
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,600
- [Mark] <i>Have a wonderful week.</i>
- You too.

1028
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,520
[Mark] <i>I'll see you next Friday.</i>

1029
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
See you then.

1030
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,880
- [Mark] <i>Okay, goodbye.</i>
- Bye!

1031
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
Wow!

1032
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,920
Okay.

1033
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,680
Such a pretty face.

1034
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,000
- So, can't forget a pretty face! Whoo-hoo!
- [father] Mmm!

1035
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,440
This is exactly why you guys
are not coming.

1036
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,160
Maybe we should go and meet his parents.

1037
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,080
No!

1038
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,920
Make sure he comes
from the right background.

1039
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,400
Right background. Sounds like it is.

1040
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,400
[Maddi laughs]

1041
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,320
[Terri] What?

1042
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,280
No. You're rushing things. No.

1043
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,680
Oh. Okay.

1044
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,240
[Cian] How would you feel about having
a partner and having love in your life?

1045
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,160
It would make me feel confident.

1046
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,440
I got pictures of girls in my brain,
right now.

1047
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,520
They look cute.

1048
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,920
And they make me feel like
I'm gonna love them.

1049
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,480
[narrator] <i>It's Friday...</i>

1050
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,440
[humming]

1051
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,960
<i>and Kelvin is getting ready
for a special night.</i>

1052
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,480
<i>His first ever date.</i>

1053
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,960
Okay, you're all ready to go.

1054
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,080
- Okay.
- Thanks, Dad.

1055
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,720
Just enjoy yourself tonight, huh?

1056
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,000
Just remember what Jodi said
in the morning.

1057
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,880
- Do a greeting with her.
- Yeah.

1058
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,240
- And then introduce each other.
- Yeah.

1059
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,240
And then talk to each other
about interests.

1060
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,480
- That's right.
- Fifty-fifty.

1061
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,600
That's right. [chuckles]

1062
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,360
You don't need to say it.
Just in your mind. Just remember it, yeah?

1063
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,400
- [Kelvin] Okay.
- Okay.

1064
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
Yeah.

1065
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,080
[Kelvin] Looks like
I'll be having fun tonight.

1066
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:02,104
