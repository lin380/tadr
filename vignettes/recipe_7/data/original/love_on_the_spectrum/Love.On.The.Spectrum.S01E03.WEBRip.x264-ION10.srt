1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,240
[Cian] What do you think love is?

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,560
[sighs]

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,320
It can make people do crazy things
that they wouldn't think of doing,

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,160
make them act all bizarre.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,280
I think it requires, um, communication,

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,200
honesty, and compromise.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,600
[narrator] <i>Maddi and Mark</i>
<i>are going on their second date</i>

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,160
<i>at the Australian Museum.</i>

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,800
<i>Mark is hoping to impress her
with his dinosaur knowledge.</i>

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,400
- Hey, Maddi.
<i>- </i>Hi, Mark. How are you?

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,600
- Nice to see you again.
- Good to see you. Hey.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,480
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,560
Awesome.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,400
- [Maddi] Haven't been here in ages.
- [Mark] Well, you're gonna love it.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,440
Here we are, lo and behold,

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,560
- the dinosaur exhibit.
- [Maddi] Ooh.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,040
[Mark] You know who these guys are?
They're raptors.

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,520
- Raptors.
- You might remember them

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,720
from movies like <i>Jurassic Park</i>
or documentaries.

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,240
Oh, I couldn't watch those movies.
I tried to.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,880
It's just too much violence and gore.
It's like, oh, my God.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,600
[Mark] Check out that toe claw.

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,040
- [Maddi] Yeah, it's so long and sharp.
- [Mark] Yes.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,640
You could take someone's eye out.

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,600
And it's very good
for killing its prey with.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,360
- How about that, eh?
- Yes.

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,680
[Mark] This one's from Africa,
Nigersaurus.

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,800
That's a Hypsilophodon.

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,600
It's a cute little dinosaur.

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,240
Sure. [chuckles]

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,640
[Mark] When they discovered
the Sinornithosaurus,

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,240
it sent shock waves
throughout the paleontological community.

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,560
This is Maiasaura.

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,080
The name Maiasaura means "good mother."

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,360
- Well, there you go.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,320
This is the femur
of the sauropod dinosaurs.

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,240
Some of them are so big, you can't even
wrap your arms around them.

38
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,280
- Here's my old favorite, Stegosaurus.
- [Maddi] Stegosaurus.

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,480
Minmi.

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,080
- Minmi?
- Yeah.

41
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,760
It's an Ankylosaurus.

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,560
Here's a really cool dinosaur.

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,360
Cryolophosaurus.

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,360
Oh.

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
[Mark] Interesting fact.

46
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,600
Tyrannosaurus Rex has the strongest,
the most powerful bite

47
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,560
of any other dinosaur.

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,920
- [Maddi] Yeah.
- Truly a formidable predator.

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,840
[Cian] Is it going well so far?

50
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,840
Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,440
I've hardly been... I haven't been...
I haven't been able to get

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,360
much, um, sentences in,

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,360
because he's always
just, like, saying something.

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,720
But that's okay, like...

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,040
It's fine, so...

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,800
[birds chirping]

57
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Ah, perfect.

58
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
[Mark exhales]

59
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,440
That was love.

60
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,800
Ah, this is perfect.

61
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,920
Yeah, fabulous.

62
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,480
[Mark] Such a beautiful place.

63
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
[Maddi] Yeah.

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,520
- Nice.
- [Mark exhales]

65
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,360
Just feel that breeze.

66
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,320
It's like Mother Nature is giving you
a nice welcoming kiss.

67
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,880
Hadn't thought about it like that.

68
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
[Mark sighs]

69
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,800
One day, um, Ma...

70
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,720
Um, Maddi, one day,
if you found the perfect guy,

71
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,320
would you like to get married?

72
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,200
Um...

73
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,960
Well...

74
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,360
Maybe, I think... I think

75
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,160
that's kind of a question...

76
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,800
when... when I find that someone...

77
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,440
- Yeah.
- ...and kinda if.

78
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,720
Do you feel anything about me?

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,080
Um... [chuckles]

80
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,080
- I know...
- Oh, jeez. Um...

81
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,400
- Yeah.
- Oh, look...

82
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,880
I think you're a very nice guy,
very smart, and very interesting.

83
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
Yeah.

84
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,520
And very good friend material.

85
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,040
- Yeah.
- I just...

86
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,400
There's no romantic feelings, like...

87
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,920
That happens a lot.

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,320
But, uh, I think you're beautiful.
You're smart as well.

89
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,640
- Oh, thank you.
- And you... you're very enthusiastic.

90
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,560
I think you have
excellent friend material.

91
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,480
There's nothing wrong with being friends.

92
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,880
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know...

93
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,680
- At least I made a new friend.
- Yes, yes.

94
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
That's the wonderful gift of life.

95
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,280
Yeah. [chuckles]

96
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,400
- Well...
- Okay.

97
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,360
- It's been a wonderful day.
- Yeah, it has been quite an experience.

98
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
- I wish you all the best.
- Thank you.

99
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,120
I hope you take care of yourself.

100
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,400
- I wish you all the best for the future.
- You too.

101
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,920
- All right.
- You as well.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,440
- Okay.
- Well, goodbye.

103
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Bye.

104
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,520
[Maddi] I've never had romantic feelings
for anyone.

105
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,080
And I'm not sure, like...

106
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,160
if it hasn't happened by now,
it might not happen, you know? So, like...

107
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,320
Like, maybe it will happen
if I meet the right person, but, like...

108
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,160
And because I never experienced it,

109
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,400
maybe I don't know
how to read the signs, or...

110
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,320
pick up the emotions, or whatever.

111
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Hey, Mark.

112
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,520
- Hey, Dad.
- [father] How'd you go?

113
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,560
- Great, we had a wonderful time.
- Great? Well done. Good on ya, fella.

114
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
So, what happened?

115
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,560
Well, we... we're not really...

116
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,080
compatible.

117
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,320
Oh, okay. That's fine.

118
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,000
- We always said that might be the case.
- Yeah.

119
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,520
Well, to be honest,
I feel a little bit sad.

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,960
Yeah, I understand.

121
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,640
- And so, you left on a good note, though?
- Yeah.

122
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,520
- A happy note?
- We're both friends, so...

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,840
- Right.
- That's all we can...

124
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,960
That's all we can ask for.

125
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

126
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,560
What do you think? Ready to go home?

127
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,240
- Yeah. It's been a long day.
- Yeah.

128
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,680
Okey-doke, let's go.

129
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,320
[squawks]

130
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,360
All right, shall we check this place out?

131
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,760
Oh, it's amazing.

132
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,600
[narrator] <i>Things might not have</i>
<i>worked out with Maddi,</i>

133
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,880
<i>but Mark hasn't given up

134
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,080
<i>Today he's meeting his friend Ryan

135
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,640
[Mark] Good thing this table's free.

136
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,960
Yeah, this is the best one in the place.

137
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,120
[slight chuckle]

138
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,920
What's going on in your life
at the moment?

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,960
- You've been searching for dates?
- Yeah.

140
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,200
Maddi was a nice person.

141
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,800
But...

142
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,920
unfortunately, we didn't have
any romantic spark between us.

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,520
- Oh, man.
- We were more keen to friends.

144
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,240
- [waitress] Banana smoothie?
- That's me.

145
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,880
- [waitress] There you go.
- Thank you.

146
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,000
- You're welcome.
- Cheers for that.

147
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,840
That is interesting.

148
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,160
Ah, yes, nothing like a nice cup of tea

149
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,520
on a wonderful afternoon like this.

150
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,440
That's true.

151
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,080
And that banana smoothie
looks really nice,

152
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,480
I've got to admit.

153
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,880
[Mark] So, what do you think girls like?

154
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,800
Humor.

155
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

156
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,680
And I do think, to get a girl to like you,
is to flatter them.

157
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,880
Oh, yes, definitely.

158
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,080
Because they have feelings
just like we do.

159
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,120
Would you prefer a girl who has
the same interest in dinosaurs?

160
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,160
That would be wonderful.

161
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,080
Yeah.

162
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,280
[Mark] It's a huge world.

163
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,400
Anything is possible.

164
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,920
I mean, I like dinosaurs too,
but not an obsession.

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,080
Well, I'm madly in love.

166
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,680
- I'm sure you are. [chuckles]
- Yeah. [chuckles]

167
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Mmm.

168
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,240
Are you, uh, dating anyone?

169
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,240
Not officially.

170
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,040
- Okay, right.
- Yeah.

171
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,280
I'm still looking.

172
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,480
Well, stay strong. You know,
someone will come along and...

173
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,800
will be right for you.

174
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,360
Yes, my soul mate is out there,
I just haven't found her yet.

175
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,240
Yeah. It will happen.

176
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,920
- It will happen.
- It will happen.

177
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
- Yep.
- Are you on any dating sites,

178
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
like Plenty of Fish or eharmony?

179
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,880
Oh, yes, I've looked into dating sites.

180
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,800
Even int...

181
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,200
Yeah?

182
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,000
Even international dating sites.

183
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,440
- [chuckles]
- International dating sites, interesting.

184
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,080
I could picture myself with a, uh,

185
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,016
Mexican girl on my right shoulder
and a Russian girl on my left shoulder.

186
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,600
[Mark laughs]

187
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
[Ryan] Yeah...

188
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,960
I guess I'm the international lover
kind of guy.

189
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Ah, okay.

190
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,800
- Yeah.
- All right.

191
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,520
Well, that was great...

192
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,480
- Oh, sure.
- ...having time with you.

193
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,400
Thanks.

194
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,880
I had a wonderful time,
and I hope we do this again.

195
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,776
- Oh, sure, my pleasure.
- You take care, Ryan.

196
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,616
- Pleasure, as always.
- Wish you all the best.

197
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,296
- [Ryan] Thanks, you too.
- Have a good day.

198
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,376
- Good luck with your search.
- [Mark] I will. You too.

199
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,160
- Thanks. [chuckles]
- See ya, Ryan.

200
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,560
- [Ryan chuckles] See ya, Mark.
- Take care.

201
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,880
[Cian] How do you feel about
being on the autism spectrum?

202
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,520
I have mixed emotions, you know.

203
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,720
Even though I'm on the spectrum,

204
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,280
I'm still capable of falling in love

205
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,720
and being a compassionate
and caring person.

206
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,880
[Cian] And have you ever had
a relationship?

207
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,520
- No.
- [Cian] So, falling in love

208
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,520
- is something you would like to do?
- Oh.

209
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
For a long time, yes.

210
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,000
It's always been on my mind,
and it's just so hard to get.

211
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,240
This is a skull of a Tyrannosaurus Rex,

212
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,960
I'm very proud of it, you know.

213
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,920
I basically worship it.

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,720
This is by a paleo artist.

215
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,880
This guy here is a grade A,
bona fide dinosaur.

216
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,400
It has a small sail on its back.

217
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,880
In the mating season,

218
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,520
you would want to show that off
and say, "Hey, baby, look at me.

219
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,560
I'm the one you want to mate with."

220
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,600
[Cian] Can you describe for me
your ideal partner?

221
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,200
I like a girl who is very passionate,

222
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
at the same time, a very...

223
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,160
calm and caring nature.

224
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,920
[Cian] What if she hates dinosaurs?

225
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
No deal.

- Hey, Mum.

Good boy.

234
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,320
I'm looking forward to Matt's wedding.

235
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,720
Have we heard any more from Matt and Emma?

236
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,440
I think in a few weeks,
you'll be going on the bucks night.

237
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,096
- Yeah, that would be fun.
- [mother] Yeah? Looking forward to that?

- Yeah.
- [mother] Yeah?

- Mm-hmm.

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,856
[father] What about you,
would you like to do that one day?

241
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,280
- Yeah.
- You can find the girl of your dreams.

242
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,560
I think you'd make a great boyfriend.

243
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,600
You're a beautiful person.

244
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,160

248
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,280
[chuckles] Oh, Bella...

249
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
[chuckles]

250
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,480
We're just amazed at how far he's come.

251
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
It... I mean, it's been
a hell of a long journey.

252
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,000
Mark, in his young age,
he had limited language, meltdowns,

253
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,480
he was destructive.

254
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,800
A lot of our friends
who had children with autism,

255
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,640
um, their marriages broke down,

256
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
and, uh, ours was strained too.

257
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,920
And so, I think I need people to know

258
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,680
that you do need to work together,
and you have to work hard,

259
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,120
and I think that
it's now paying dividends.

260
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,440
Sorry. [chuckles]

261
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,320
[shuddering] It gets a bit emotional...

262
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,320
because it has been a hard road,

263
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,200
but we've seen light at the end
of the tunnel.

264
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,680
And we've seen Mark just come so far.

265
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,320
[Cian] How would you describe
your ideal girlfriend?

266
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,120
Clever, intelligent,

267
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,920
energetic, athletic, strong...

268
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,840
brave, grateful.

269
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,240
And she smells good.

270
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,440
[Cian] She smells good.

271
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,280
And perhaps has a...

272
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
smell of orange juice,

273
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,960

349
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,920
All right! Yummy!

350
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,480
So, now I cook the seafood first.

351
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,320
Ooh, fish!

352
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,760
Ooh.

353
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,560
- Cutting up prawn.
- [chef] Yes.

354
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,080
I did read that you had to cut out
the head from the prawn

355
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
when you cook them.

356
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,680
Didn't think
you'd have to cut out the guts, too.

357
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,800
- Ooh.
- [Kelvin] Ooh!

358
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,640
- [chef] Thank you.
- Ah, wow.

359
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,920
- You're so smart!
- [chef] Thank you.

360
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,320
- All right, please try prawn first.
- Thank you.

361
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,080
- [Jessica] I will burn myself.
- <i>Kono ebi wa etsui desu.</i>

362
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,600
<i>Hai. Ebisu.</i>

363
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,520
<i>Itadakimasu.</i>

364
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,720
Yeah, what he said. <i>Bon appétit.</i>

365
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,920
<i>Bon appétit!</i>

366
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yummy.

367
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,000
[child exclaims]

368
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,760
Mmm. Not half bad.

369
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,280
[chef] And we make a fire...

370
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,240
[Jessica] Fire?

371
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
Ready?

372
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,240
One, two, three, go!

373
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,560
[Kelvin] Oh!

374
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,520
Hoo, Jesus Christ!

375
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,120
- It is a fire.
- Fire, yeah.

376
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,200
<i>Arigato gozaimasu.</i>

377
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,440
[chef speaking Japanese]

378
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,560
Kelvin, you've been speaking
a lot of Japanese.

379
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,720
Yes, I've been speaking Japanese
for three years.

380
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,480
[chef] And now, we get to play games,
all right?

381
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,880
Can you catch your bowl first?

382
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,720
- Two hands. Yeah.
- Oh, wait a minute.

383
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,000
One, two, three...

384
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,000
Catch! Good, yes.

385
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,120
Oh, I-I learned it
from my teacher, Travis-san.

386
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,560
Ah, nice!

387
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,936
- Every Wednesday or Friday.
- [man] Kelvin, you want to try?

388
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,440
- Yes.
- Two hands on the bowl.

389
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,880
- Good. Yes.
- Yes.

390
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
All right, ready?

391
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,840
Catch, all right? One, two, three...

392
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,240
- Catch! Good.
- All right.

393
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,520
- [chef] You got it?
- Yeah.

394
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,280
- [chef] There's your rice.
- [Jessica] Thank you.

395
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,760
How do you make eating with chopsticks
so easy?

396
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,840
I'm a Chinese boy.

397
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,760
And I come from a Chinese family.

398
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,360
- Oh.
- But I was born here in Australia.

399
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
[Jessica] I hope you don't mind me
making a mess.

400
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,880
I'm just trying to get used to these.

401
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,920
How do you make them work
so well for you, Kelvin?

402
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,720
What is it?
What is it you're talking about?

403
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,920
- The chopsticks.
- The chopsticks, oh.

404
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Copy me.

405
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,760
No, not like that.

406
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,240
Oh, yeah.

407
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,680
Use your thumb in front of the chopsticks,
only the thumb.

408
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
[Jessica] Oh.

409
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
- [Kelvin] Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

410
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
[Kelvin] Oh...

411
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Um...

412
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
You're welcome.

413
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
So...

414
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,280
Do you like koalas?

415
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
I do like 'em.

416
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,520
And one day,

417
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,160
would you like to go
to the koala park with me?

418
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,080
I would like...
I actually would like that.

419
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,440
How about Taronga Zoo?

420
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,560
Where, Taronga Zoo?

421
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,000
- [Jessica] Mm-hmm.
- That's a...

422
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,400
It's in Mosman.

423
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,400
[siren wailing]

424
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,520
[Kelvin]
Have you seen the ambulance out there?

425
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,760
What are they doing?

426
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,640
I don't know, but it can't be good.

427
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,080
I just hope they aren't coming in here,
though.

428
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,440
Excuse me,
I have to go to the bathroom, please.

429
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,440
Can I go to bathroom, please?
I'll be right back.

430
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,560
Oh, okay.

431
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
[Kelvin] Thank you.

432
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Be back.

433
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,320
[Cian] What do you think of Kelvin, Jess?

434
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,640
He's actually pretty nice, if you ask me.

435
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,560
But he often had issues
trying to understand me,

436
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,040
and vice versa.

437
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,000
Maybe it's
because I'm not good at rolling my...

438
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,080
[rolls tongue]

439
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,960
R's, I can't do it.

440
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,480
Cian, uh,
Jessica's a very nice girl to me.

441
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,160
She likes video games,

442
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,000
movies, and traveling.

443
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,680
And... But she doesn't like anime.

444
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,776
- [Jessica] That's not true.
- Or manga.

445
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,680
I actually do like anime,

446
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,840
I just like video games more.

447
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,016
[Cian] Why don't you go join her again
and we can talk later, okay?

448
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
[Kelvin] Okay.

449
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,080
Anything you like most,
other than video games?

450
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,080
Oh, I like using the computer.

451
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
- Using the "competter"?
- Yeah.

452
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
What?

453
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,520
Using the "competter"?

454
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
"Competter"?

455
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
The computer?

456
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,280
I'm sorry, I don't want to be racist
or anything.

457
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
What, what?

458
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,960
As in, you know, you said "competter."

459
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,000
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

460
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,280
I'm not trying to be mean
or anything, but...

461
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,840
Competter?

462
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm sorry, but I meant computer.

463
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,640
You know, laptop?

464
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
The laptop.

465
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,600
- PC?
- Like my daddy uses.

466
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,240
- At home.
- Oh, heads up.

467
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,000
All right, ice cream.

468
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,160
Oh, caramel.

469
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,720
- Enjoy.
- <i>Arigato gozaimasu.</i>

470
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,840
<i>Dou itashimashite.</i>

471
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,760
[cheering]

472
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,880
Damn, that is good ice cream.

473
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,160
- You like yours?
- [Kelvin] Mmm, I like this.

474
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,760
It was great going out
on our first date together.

475
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,640
Yeah, but don't automatically think
we're gonna start kissing right now.

476
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,920
Oh, oh, fine.

477
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,960
Like, you're a great guy and all, but...
[slight chuckle]

478
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,680
- I'm not ready to fall in love yet.
- You don't think I'm a g...

479
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,360
You don't think I'm a great guy?

480
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,040
No, I don't think... I don't think...
You're not a bad person or anything.

481
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,040
You don't feel like loving me?

482
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,720
You know what?
You're actually a great person.

483
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,120
I'd actually like to hang out with you
more as a friend.

484
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,480
Not in the romantic way, just in the...

485
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,680
platonic way.

486
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,320
- Platonic?
- Yeah.

487
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,280
So, can I...

488
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,920
- add you to my contacts?
- Okay.

489
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,840
- And what's your phone number?
- [Jessica] I'll just show it to you.

490
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,560
Oh, that's fine.

491
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,440
[Jessica] Just type this.

492
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,920
So, it's been a great time
going on a date together.

493
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,040
Yes. Hopefully, I'll get to catch up
with you sometime soon enough.

494
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,160
Okay, see you!

495
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,040
- Bye, Kelvin!
- Bye, bye!

496
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,400
[Jessica] Like, he's a really nice guy.

497
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,400
I bet he'll find someone
who loves him for who he is.

498
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,840
But he kind of sucks at video games.

499
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,000
She doesn't like manga or anime so much,

500
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,200
but she likes video gaming more than that.

501
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,760
It's better to be friends
than being an official girlfriend.

502
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,400
[Cian] What does love mean for you, Maddi?

503
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Well...

504
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,800
love should mean that you stand by
the person you're in love with,

505
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,960
through thick and thin,

506
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
and you don't bail...

507
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,680
just 'cause you're bored.

508
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,800
And it means, like, supporting them,

509
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,600
and not just...
not just turning a blind eye

510
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,200
to when they clearly need help, so...

511
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,640
- [Cian] When are you happiest?
- With family.

512
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,560
Family is like, um, brownies.

513
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,480
They're a really sweet bunch,
but you can't avoid getting a few nuts.

514
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
[chuckles]

515
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,320
Right! [claps hands]
Are we ready to get ready for the date?

516
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,560
Yes, let's go get ready.

517
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,920
[narrator] <i>After Maddi didn't feel</i>
<i>any chemistry with Mark,</i>

518
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,160
<i>today she's preparing to meet someone new.</i>

519
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,640
- Here are the pants.
- Uh-huh.

520
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Good.

521
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
[Maddi] Here's the shirt.

522
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,920
- Remembering that that goes to the back.
- Yes.

523
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,520
People on the spectrum,
they don't read the social cues

524
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,720
that we all read.

525
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,920
They get a lot of their social cues
off television.

526
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,760
And it was very early on I realized

527
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,240
that I had to be the one
she was getting her social cues off.

528
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,160
- Hey. How's it going?
- Oh!

529
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,120
Oh, come around. Show me, show me,
show me, show me, show me.

530
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,760
Oh, that's good.

531
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,320
Okay, how you feeling about it all?

532
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,640
A tad nervous, but... [chuckles]

533
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,280
Do you wanna go through a rehearsal?

534
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,280
- Yeah, good idea.
- Steve, you're the barman.

535
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,416
- What are you gonna do when you meet him?
- Hi, nice to meet you, I'm Maddi.

536
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,280
Oh, hi, Mad...
Maddi, you don't need to...

537
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,560
- What?
- That's very hard.

538
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,480
You've got a weak handshake
'cause you're old.

539
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,880
Okay. Lovely to meet you, Maddi.

540
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,736
- Can I get you a drink?
- A lemonade, please.

541
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
- Lemonade.
- A lemonade, too. Thank you, barman.

542
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Two lemonades.

543
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,120
So, you look lovely.

544
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,520
Oh, thank you, you look decent as well.

545
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,640
You look decent? [laughs]

546
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,640
[Maddi] It depends
on what his outfit looks like.

547
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,040
What do you do for a living?

548
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,360
I'm a jewelry designer.

549
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,600
- Yes.
- That job must rock.

550
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,520
That's a good one! That's a good one!

551
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,480
[laughter]

552
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,440
- Your table is ready.
- Thank you.

553
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,480
- Maddison, would you like to go to dinner?
- Yes.

554
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,680
Sit there, I'll sit over here with Steve.

555
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,360
So, the idea
is to keep the conversation flowing.

556
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,920
Do you have any siblings?

557
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,280
Uh, I have two sisters and two brothers.

558
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,880
What about you?

559
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,920
Two brothers and two sisters.

560
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,480
And I have six nephews and lots of nieces.

561
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,840
So, that's a lot of nieces and nephews...

562
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,200
- Do you want children of your own?
- No, never.

563
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,200
When you're answer is no,

564
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,680
you leave nowhere for the person to go.

565
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,400
Because what you're trying to do
is keep the conversation going.

566
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,720
Let's try again.

567
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,520
Do you want children of your own?

568
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,560
No, because I think
they're a waste of time and money.

569
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,360
Good lord.

570
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,600
- [Terri laughs]
- [father] What is that smile?

571
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,440
- I don't know.
- What is that smile?

572
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,520
- Am I not allowed to smile?
- [Terri] No, people like smiles.

573
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,320
- Just be yourself, gorgeous.
- Just relax.

574
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,600
You're telling me
to keep the conversation going,

575
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,760
but telling me not to tell people
what they wanna hear,

576
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,800
so I don't know how to combine those two.

577
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,320
You can. You can still be honest,
and... and say,

578
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,080
"Look, I don't think
I'm ready for children.

579
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,840
I may never be ready for children."
It just leaves it open.

580
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,520
"I <i>may </i>never"? I don't want to, like,
put any maybe in there,

581
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,480
in case he, like... I give him false hope.

582
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,600
I don't want to, like, not prepare for it,

583
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,720
and it comes up
and I don't know what to do, so...

584
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,120
cover everything.

585
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,096
The chances of something coming up
that we haven't covered is pretty high.

586
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,880
We're gonna need to sit here
for ages, then.

587
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,480
- No, we're not.
- [Maddi] Yes, we are.

588
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
You can't send me out there
without being prepared.

589
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,720
It is meant to be fun.

590
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
Yeah, it is.

591
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,880
Okay.

592
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
So exciting, huh?

593
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Yes. [chuckles]

594
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,160
- [Cian] Are you a romantic person, Mark?
- Yes.

595
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,720
Absolutely.

596
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,200
And I just want to share my life

597
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,160
with someone very special,

598
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,440
and just show her the person
that I really am,

599
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,120
and to show her that my disability
is not an obstacle,

600
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,120
that I'm capable of falling in love.

601
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,640
[Cian] If you do find love,
how do you think you'd know?

602
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960
I feel like my heart skips a beat.

603
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,200
My smile begins to beam.

604
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,440
I just feel...

605
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,840
entranced.

606
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
[narrator] <i>Today, Mark is going bowling</i>

607
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,160
<i>with a social group
set up for people on the spectrum.</i>

608
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,960
[Mark] The social club is about people
with disabilities coming together,

609
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,280
making friends, and having fun,

610
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,200
which is very important,

611
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,960
not just to me, but to everyone else
that has a disability.

612
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,840
Hi Mark, you came.

613
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,640
Gonna sign up and play?

614
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,560
- Okay, cool.
- Yeah.

615
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,880
How about you, Christina?

616
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,456
- You good?
- [Christina] I'm all right.

617
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,320
You ready to have some fun tonight, guys?

618
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,440
Oh, yes.

619
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,080
Oh... no, no, no!

620
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,320
What do you... What do you think
about the new girls here?

621
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,920
Yeah, they're nice.

622
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,480
They're nice. I might like to talk to them
a bit more later on.

623
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,280
You know, get to know them better.

624
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,360
So, how's your night been so far?
You enjoying yourself?

625
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,600
Yeah! Yeah, it's cool.

626
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,960
- I haven't bowled in ages, but...
- Yeah.

627
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,520
So, do you have any family?

628
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,800
Um...

629
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,720
[chuckles]

630
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,280
Well, yes, I have family.

631
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
[chuckles]

632
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,240
It's just me and my mum at home.

633
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
Okay, I have a brother and a sister,

634
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,560
and I have a mum and dad
at home right now.

635
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,840
And, uh, my sister will be...

636
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,200
expecting soon in May.

637
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,320
Oh, wow.

638
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,720
I... I don't really care

639
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,680
- if it's a boy or a girl...
- [chuckles]

640
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,880
...as long as we're getting
a new little...

641
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,840
little baby child.

642
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,240
Well, that's certainly happening.

643
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,680
- Yes.
- [laughs]

644
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
Oh.

645
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Ready to go.

646
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Righto.

647
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,880
[Mark] Good luck, Presley.

648
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,400
Thank... Oh, thank you. [chuckles]

649
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,160
[woman] Oh, that's a good one!

650
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,440
We'll... We'll see.

651
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,400
[Mark] Yes!

652
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,960
- Um, Presley?
- Yes?

653
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,720
What are your interests in?

654
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,440
I'm keen to know, what do you like?

655
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,720
Um, I like to draw.

656
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,160
Oh, that's great.

657
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,720
Yeah, I really enjoy that.

658
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,880
I like drawing nature

659
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,600
- and, like, animals and stuff.
- Oh, that's beautiful.

660
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,960
- Yeah.
- Very beautiful.

661
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,120
What do you like to do?

662
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,840
Play video games, watch movies,
read books.

663
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,680
Yeah. What movies are you into?

664
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,280
Which ones are you into?

665
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,680
Um... [inhales]

666
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,880
Well... [exhales]

667
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,880
Um, just...

668
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Uh, well...

669
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,280
Just...

670
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,400
Sorry, I'm... blanking out.

671
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,176
- Hang on, sorry. Excuse me for a second.
- That's okay. You all right?

672
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,400
[Mark, softly] Oh, God.

673
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,280
Sorry. I just blanked out
from nervousness.

674
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,560
[exhales] I was just talking to her,
and just don't know what to say.

675
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Couldn't talk.

676
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,120
Just... just... just be yourself, man.
Just... just...

677
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,400
And just... ask your questions, you know?

678
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,600
- Just build on those conversations.
- Right.

679
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,080
- [man] You'll do fine.
- [man 2] You're doing great, Mark.

680
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,720
Just breathe.

681
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,240
[Mark] Come on.

682
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360

00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,000
Hi, are you Severin?

694
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,280
Hey. Yeah.

695
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,920
- Maddi, nice to meet you.
- You're Maddi. Yep.

696
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,040
Well, you know, how was your day, I guess.

697
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,320
Oh, yeah, pretty good.

698
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,400
Pretty good, just catching up on...

699
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,880
chores, errands, bits and pieces, so...

700
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,480
- Yeah.
- And your... how was your day?

701
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,720
Um...

702
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,360
Let's see... Well, um...

703
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,000
had an appointment earlier, and...

704
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,480
other than that, um...

705
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,480
- sprucing up a bit. [chuckles]
- Ah.

706
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,000
'Cause, um...

707
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Well, yeah.

708
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,040
Uh, so...

709
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,760
Yeah... So, um...

710
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,880
What do you like to do for fun?

711
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,320
Oh.

712
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,240
Uh, I... I love video games.

713
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,560
I'm a huge video game nerd, so... [laughs]

714
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,840
Nice, same.

715
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,560
What kind of games do you play?

716
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,240
- I play <i>The Sims 4. </i>That's a great game.
- Yep.

717
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,640
<i>- </i>You can create or destroy.
- [chuckles]

718
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,040
- I'm the ruler.
- [Severin] Nice.

719
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,760
- [Maddi] Yeah.
- Um...

720
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,440
So...

721
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah, um...

722
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Um... [exhales]

723
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,080
[exhales]

724
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,000
Yeah.

725
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,320
[both softly grunt]

726
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Um...

727
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,360
- So, um...
- [child screams]

728
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,480
- Goodness me, listen to that noise.
- Wow.

729
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,320
Screaming kids, that is horrible noise.
It's like, be quiet.

730
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,480
- Um...
- [Maddi] Thank God it stopped.

731
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,920
Like, do you think you'd ever
want kids one day? Like...

732
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,480
Oh, it's... It's funny for me.
Like, if you asked me maybe a year ago,

733
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,600
I'd be like, "No, I never want children,
ever! Ever, ever!"

734
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,296
- [laughs]
- Like, that's what I was like,

735
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,360
but I think as I've gotten older,
like, I...

736
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,680
Changed your mind a bit?

737
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Like, I've become more open to the idea.

738
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,640
I don't really know if I'd ever want kids.

739
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,160
I... I'm open to the idea,

740
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,720
like, eventually if I was to find,
like, the right person...

741
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,000
- Hmm, but yeah.
- Yeah, being open-minded, so...

742
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
Yeah.

743
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,360
Crumbs, I was afraid this would happen.

744
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,640
It's starting to fall apart.

745
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,760
Oh, whoa.

746
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,480
[Maddi laughing] Oh.

747
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,040
[Severin] Yeah.

748
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Ah...

749
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Oh.

750
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
[clears throat]

751
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,560
[waitress] All done, guys?

752
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,800
- [Severin] Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

753
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,296
- [Severin] Yeah.
- All good? [laughs]

754
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
No worries.

755
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,440
How was everything?

756
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,640
- Delicious, thank you.
- [Severin] Yeah, pretty good.

757
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,120
Great. All good.

758
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Um...

759
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,560
May I ask, what do you potentially think
you want to do as a career one day?

760
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,640
I think something with...
something with animals.

761
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,560
- I did an animal studies course at TAFE.
- [Severin] Okay.

762
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,320
Now I'm doing
Cert III Music Industry at TAFE.

763
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,360
- The piano...
- Oh.

764
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,360
...specifically.

765
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
- Nice.
- [Severin] Um...

766
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,080
Absolutely love piano
with great burning passion, so...

767
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,680
When I was in high school,
and I heard a guy playing,

768
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,040
I... I think it was actually
the <i>Skyrim </i>theme on piano,

769
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,040
Oh, wow.

770
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,680
That's what sparked a bit of interest.

771
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,560
And then I started,
like, self-teaching myself.

772
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,240
- Wow.
- And um... yeah.

773
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,440
I do have a surprise for you.

774
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,600
Oh. [slight chuckle]

775
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,160
'Cause, did you know,
there's a piano they have right here.

776
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,320
Oh, my goodness.

777
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,760
- I didn't notice that on the way in, no.
- [Severin] Yeah.

778
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,160
You like <i>Skyrim,</i> right?

779
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,240
Yeah...

780
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,720
[plays <i>Skyrim </i>theme]

781
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,880
Oh, I recognize that.

782
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,280
- Wow, like...
- [Severin exhales]

783
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,080
A bit improvisation, a bit...

784
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
actual <i>Skyrim.</i>

785
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,440
[Severin] Uh...

786
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,120
Seriously, you are really good at that.

787
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,720
- Yeah.
- Did you have lessons

788
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,656
- when you were younger, or like...?
- No, I've...

789
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,936
- All self-taught?
- I've self...

790
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,920
Well, pretty much, yeah.
I've self-taught since I was 18.

791
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,720
That's very impressive
for self-taught then.

792
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,920
Oh, man.

793
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,240
- Y-You all right?
- [Maddi] Yeah.

794
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,160
Uh, um...

795
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,200
[Severin exhales] So, yeah...

796
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,280
Is it the first date where you said
they played <i>Skyrim </i>for you on the piano?

797
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,400
Yeah, it's the first time
anyone's done that for me.

798
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,640
- So, thank you very much. Very accurate.
- [chuckles]

799
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,920
- But yeah, um...
- [Maddi] All right.

800
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,640
- Well...
- Well, I had a good evening, Severin.

801
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,680
Thank you for coming out here
and doing this. Nice to get to know you.

802
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,160
- Yeah, nice to get to know you, too. Um...
- Yeah.

803
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,880
So, uh, you know...

804
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,160
Do, like...

805
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
Uh...

806
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,920
Do you want to do this again
sometime or...

807
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,240
Yeah, it's a good... It's a good idea.
We should... We should do this again.

808
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Fair enough, um...

809
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,400
Okay, um...

810
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,240
- Yeah, I'll call you then.
- All right.

811
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,360
It was nice meeting you.

812
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,520
Nice to meet you, too.
Thanks for coming out, and...

813
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
- Yep.
- [Maddi] That's everything, so...

814
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,600
- Bye.
- Have a great night.

815
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,080
- You too, bye.
- [Severin] Yep.

816
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,560
See ya, have a great one.

817
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,280
She seems fairly geeky as well,
which is, you know, my type.

818
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,920
You know, I like someone
who's a bit nerdy, like me.

819
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,560
I think there may be potential there
for something great.

820
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,160
[line trilling]

821
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,320
[Terri] <i>Hey, Maddi.</i>

822
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,040
Hey, how are you guys?

823
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,080
[Terri] <i>Good! How was your date?</i>

824
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,000
Oh, yeah, really good. He was very...

825
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,680
Severin was a very interesting guy.

826
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,080
[Terri] <i>Yeah? Cool!</i>

827
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,080
He played piano for... for me
at the... at the restaurant.

828
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,600
At the pub, so... [laughs]

829
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,160
[Terri] <i>Oh, my Lord! Was he very good?</i>

830
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,680
Oh, he is really good.

831
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,960
You know that game I play, <i>Skyrim?</i>

832
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,496
- [Terri] <i>Yeah.</i>
- [father] <i>Yeah.</i>

833
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,616
He played me a music track on there
which I recognize.

834
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,400
I was like, "Wow, how accurate!"

835
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,240
[Terri] <i>Oh, wow, so you obviously had</i>
<i>a lot more interest in him</i>

836
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,680
<i>than the last guy, right?</i>

837
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,840
Suppose so.

838
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,496
[Terri] <i>Excellent. That sounds like</i>
<i>a very successful night, then.</i>

839
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,360
Yeah.

840
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,280
[Terri] <i>Okay, all right. Well, then, uh,</i>
<i>we'll see you home soon, hey.</i>

841
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,600
Bye, guys. See you later. Bye.

842
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,720
- [Cian] They sound happy.
- Yeah.

843
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
[zips purse]

844
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,880
They always insist
on being part of my life, so... [laughs]

845
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,240
As parents do, I suppose.

846
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
[laughs]

847
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,400
Yeah.

848
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,720
[Cian] What do you think's the biggest
challenge you've had to overcome?

849
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,560
Um... [exhales]

850
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,800
Trying to work on my social skills, and...

851
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
trying to...

852
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
you know...

853
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,320
see how the real world works,
and stuff like that.

854
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,600
It's been a huge challenge.

855
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,480
[birds chirping]

856
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,600
- Can't wait for today's activities.
- It's a good opportunity, too, darling.

857
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,680
Oh, yes.

858
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,440
[narrator] <i>Today, Mark is attending</i>
<i>a dating workshop,</i>

859
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,080
<i>hoping to learn skills that will help him
in his search for love.</i>

860
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,200
- Have a great day.
- Well, you too.

861
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Hope you learn a lot...

862
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,496
- I will.
- And get a lot out of today.

863
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,040
- See ya, Dad.
- See ya, mate.

864
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,800
[narrator] <i>Dr. Elizabeth Laugeson</i>
<i>is the director of PEERS,</i>

865
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,800
<i>a social skills training program
for people on the autism spectrum,</i>

866
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,280
<i>developed at the University of California.</i>

867
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,200
One of the biggest misconceptions

868
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,400
that I've found
about people on the spectrum

869
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,920
is that they're perfectly happy

870
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,840
not being social, not dating,

871
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,440
and that just really is very rarely true.

872
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,160
You guys excited for today?

873
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,080
[all] Yes.

874
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,200
[Elizabeth] For years, my phone
has just been ringing off the hook

875
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,880
from adults and their family members,

876
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,240
um, desperate to learn
how to develop romantic relationships.

877
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,000
So that's where we come in
with our dating boot camps,

878
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,000
is to try to teach the skills
that many people sort of take for granted

879
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,720
and use naturally in dating situations.

880
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,880
Dating is a choice, right?

881
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,280
Do we get to date everybody?

882
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,240
No.

883
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,360
No. Does everyone get to date us?

884
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,280
No.

885
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,680
What could be the problem with choosing
someone who's maybe not so nice?

886
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,920
- They could be doing drugs or alcohol.
- [Elizabeth] Yeah.

887
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,200
- They could be part of a gang or...
- [Elizabeth] Yeah.

888
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,560
Would that be a good choice
in someone to date?

889
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,760
- No.
- So we're all clear,

890
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,680
there's good choices and bad choices
when it comes to dating, right?

891
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,640
[birds chirping]

892
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,360
When we're on a date,

893
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,240
we have to be able
to make conversation with people.

894
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,120
Remember, we're supposed
to trade information.

895
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,560
Well, there's lots of rules
about trading information.

896
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,176
So one of the things you do
is you're gonna ask questions, right?

897
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,320
Because what is the goal,
what are you trying to find?

898
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,720
[man] Find common interests.

899
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,160
Exactly. And so,
in order to find common interests,

900
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,120
you have to share things
about yourself as well.

901
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,040
Yes.

902
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,400
[Elizabeth] Okay, we're gonna see
a few role-plays about what not to do.

903
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,160
So I want you guys
to watch this role-play,

904
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,080
and I want you to notice
what Nathan is doing wrong

905
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,280
in trying to trade information.

906
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,200
-So, Lizzie, what'd you do on the weekend?

907
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,256
- I just went to the beach.
- Oh, cool, which beach?

908
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,440
- Uh, Bronte.
- Oh, did you go with your friends?

909
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,736
- Yeah, a couple friends.
- Did you go swimming or surfing?

910
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,840
- Uh, swimming.
- Oh, do you build sandcastles?

911
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,920
- [laughs]
- [Nathan] Do you play beach volleyball?

912
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,800
[Elizabeth] All right, timeout.
So what did Nathan do wrong, Joseph?

913
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,200
Um, ask too many questions.

914
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,800
He was being an interviewer, right?

915
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,280
It's not a reciprocal conversation,
so they're not finding common interests.

916
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,080
It has to go back and forth.

917
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,720
Okay, watch this next role-play.

918
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Think about what Nathan is doing wrong
this time.

919
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,120
So, Lizzie, who was the last person
you dated?

920
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,200
[Lizzie] Uh... Jason.

921
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,480
Did you love him?

922
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,416
- [Lizzie] Uh... Yeah.
- [Nathan] What about me?

923
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,360
Do you love me?

924
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,000
Uh, sorry. Could we order dinner first?

925
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,640
When are we gonna go on our honeymoon?

926
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,560
- [Lizzie] I'm just not... Sorry.
- [Nathan] When should we get married?

927
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,920
[Elizabeth] Okay, timeout.
So what did Nathan do wrong?

928
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,960
A little bit too personal.

929
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,400
He was getting too personal.

930
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,720
Yeah, what else? Mark?

931
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,880
It was like this.
He put the hammer down too soon, you know?

932
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,520
Got right into it <i>way </i>too quickly.

933
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,120
Yeah, right, kinda came on <i>way </i>too strong.

934
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Joseph?

935
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,520
Was being a bit too imposing
and getting down her throat a bit.

936
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,760
Yeah, exactly.

937
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,000
All right, guys. Well, now that we know
how to trade information

938
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,840
and hopefully make conversations
during dates,

939
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,520
we're gonna practice this.

940
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,640
So, who wants to go first?

941
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,720
Okay, Mark, wonderful. Come on up
to the front of the room here with Lizzie.

942
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,880
We're gonna imagine
that you're on a date with Lizzie,

943
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,976
- and you're just making conversation.
- [Mark] Yeah.

944
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,040
And what will your goal be
in this conversation?

945
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,120
- To find common interests.
- [Elizabeth] Very good. All right.

946
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,040
So, what do you like to get up to
on weekends?

947
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,200
I kinda like playing tennis
and things like that.

948
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,600
- Oh, yes.
- Swimming, yeah...

949
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,040
- Well, my mum plays tennis.
- Oh cool, nice.

950
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,400
She used to be in the...
the league, but...

951
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,440
She doesn't anymore.

952
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,720
You know, so she just does it
in her spare time.

953
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,440
Yeah. That sounds fun. Have you tried it?

954
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,600
I have, but I'm a little bit sloppy at it.

955
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,880
- Keep missing it, it's just...
- [laughs]

956
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,560
[laughs]

957
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,480
I just...

958
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,200
Um, just...

959
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,000
Um, just trying to think...

960
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,440
Sorry, I'm... Oh.

961
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,960
So, don't worry about that.
You're doing a fantastic job.

962
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,000
But think about questions
that you might ask the other person...

963
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,016
- Oh, yes.
- ...to sort of get out their interests.

964
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,336
And then you're doing a good job
of sharing about yourself,

965
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,720
but always making sure
you're also checking in with Lizzie.

966
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,160
Question, do you ever find it difficult

967
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,960
to sort of come up
with new topics to talk about?

968
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,336
- Yes.
- [Elizabeth] Yeah. Does...

969
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,040
Does that happen to other people too?

970
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,600
- [woman] Yep.
- [Elizabeth] Yeah.

971
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,920
So, you know what?
This is a great opportunity

972
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,160
for all of us as a group
to maybe brainstorm

973
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,880
what are some common topics

974
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,960
that people talk about on dates?

975
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,120
[man] Family.

976
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,920
Family, exactly. What else?

977
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,120
- Holidays?
- [Elizabeth] Holidays!

978
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,960
[Elizabeth] A lot of people think
that social skills are abstract,

979
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,640
but in reality, we're all naturally
following concrete rules and steps,

980
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,960
and so it's really critical
that we outline

981
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,160
what these steps are for our young adults.

982
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,480
What else do you like to do?

983
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,880
Go hiking, or to the beach,
or see my friends...

984
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,280
- What about you?
- Well...

985
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,000
[inhales] I like to...
to go hiking as well.

986
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,120
- I love to get out in nature.
- [Lizzie] You do?

987
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Yeah, it's so much fun.

988
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,080
It makes me feel peace
whenever I'm in nature.

989
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,600
- Wouldn't you agree?
- Yeah. Yeah, I totally agree. Yeah.

990
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,040
I got lost last time I went.

991
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,960
- [laughs]
- Oh.

992
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,600
- Well, I know my way around the forest.
- Oh, that's good, yeah. [laughs]

993
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,520
- It's a very good skill to have. Yeah.
- Yeah.

994
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,760
I think Mark did a great job.
What do you guys think?

995
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,280
I think he did awesome.

996
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,576
- Shall we give him a round of applause?
- Yes. Thank you.

997
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,680
- [Elizabeth] That was fantastic.
- [applause]

998
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,120
[Kelvin] Well done, Mark.

999
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,000
Thank you, thanks.

1000
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Thank you.

1001
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
[birds chirping]

1002
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,136
Okay, well, it's just been such a pleasure
working with all of you.

1003
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,760
I'm so, so, proud of all of the...
the progress I just saw in one day.

1004
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,320
I just want to wish you all
the best of luck in dating.

1005
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,560
You know, dating can be hard, for anybody.

1006
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,160
But now you guys have all the tools
that you need,

1007
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,040
and it'll be a whole new experience
for you moving forward.

1008
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,360
I wish you guys
the very, very best of luck,

1009
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,360
and a big round of applause to all of you.

1010
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,040
- Congratulations...
- [applause]

1011
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,960
...on completing our boot camp.

1012
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,720
[wind chime jingling]

1013
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,320
Can you feel those?
Do you think they look cold enough?

1014
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
Perfect, yeah.

1015
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,600
[narrator] <i>Armed with the skills</i>
<i>he learned at boot camp,</i>

1016
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,680
<i>Mark is getting ready
for a date at the zoo.</i>

1017
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,720
[Cian] What are your hopes for today?

1018
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,560
I hope we enjoy each other's company

1019
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,040
- and we have a good time.
- Yeah.

1020
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,800
Just be your adorable, beautiful self.

1021
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,240
- [chuckles] Thanks.
- And...

1022
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,600
pay attention to what she's interested in.

1023
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,600
- Tell here about yourself.
- I will.

1024
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,360
Sometimes girls like to talk
about themselves, too...

1025
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,360
- Yeah.
- ...a little bit.

1026
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,720
I know. I know.

1027
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,120
I've got one tip for you, Mark.
You know how you've been going to the gym?

1028
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,016
You want her to see your muscles,
so this is how you do it, just like...

1029
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,760
You go like this, and you go,
"Do you see the pelicans over there?"

1030
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,976
- And let her see it, okay?
- What do you think of that?

1031
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,096
- She'll be impressed.
- What do you think of that tip?

1032
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,560
- I know, I know.
- [laughs]

1033
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,960
Just let me handle it my way.

1034
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,280
- Yeah, thanks, Dad.
- Yes.

1035
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,720
[laughs] Thanks for nothing.

1036
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,440
Yeah, thanks.... Thanks.

1037
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,800
- So happy for him.
- Ah, it'll be great, won't it?

1038
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,320
Bye, sweet.

1039
00:42:29,344 --> 00:42:32,344
